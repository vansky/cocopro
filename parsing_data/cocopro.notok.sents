For students working in a miniature factory at the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is now.
``When our students go into industry, they will have state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the workplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic business laboratory.
Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging laboratory.
The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced such programs in the country.
Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms. Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Students can see how the factory of the future operates.''
The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms. Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.
In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent, 4-foot metal sentry.
The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a pivoting base.
The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks.
The robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe or milling machine.
The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court.
The machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting shops, Ms. Alptekin said.
Students learn to program a computer and automated machines linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation - retrieving raw materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into finished products at the lathe.
Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.
But the product is less important than the process.
Ms. Alptekin said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation and financial consulting.
In the factory of the future, according to the university's model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.
``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekin said, referring to programming that allows components such as the automated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of parts.
Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even from industries where robots and automated machines have become almost commonplace.
There, she said, robots perform specific tasks in ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the production line.
Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile industry, but she would like to see it expanded.
``It should be used in any industry,'' she said.
``It's difficult to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can be easily justified.
``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.
A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to altering it to create a new product.
Ms. Alptekin said the student identified what new production components were necessary and determined how they could be integrated into the system.
A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will allow the system to diagnose itself.
The system could be programmed to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled component, much as human managers would react.
Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using is on the cutting edge of manufacturing.
``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level of expertise,'' he said.
``I know that our lab is one of the best of its kind in an educational institution.''
The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills - and teamwork.
``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms. Alptekin said.
Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab.
She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision sophisticated enough to act as an inspector.
The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987.
An estimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.
International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2 million in computer equipment and software to the university as part of an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the country.
``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said Andy Russell, a spokesman for IBM.
``IBM will benefit because we will be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing) workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''
An early morning house fire killed a woman and a firefighter who was fatally injured as he searched the house, officials said Saturday.
Four other members of the woman's family were injured.
Fire Investigator Ray Mauck said the 4 a.m. fire started in the front room of the house in northwest Wichita but he would not comment on the cause.
``We are fairly sure at this time that it was an accidental fire,'' he said.
Killed were Tilda Sue Price, 53, and firefighter C.C. Killingsworth, 39, a 17-year veteran of the Wichita Fire Department.
Mrs. Price's husband, Everett Price, 63, and their daughters, Corine, 22, and Valrie, 16, escaped and were in serious condition Saturday night at St. Francis Regional Medical Center, hospital officials said.
Another firefighter was treated for minor injuries and released.
Killingsworth's colleagues praised him a dedicated firefighter.
``He was a very aggressive firefighter.
He loved the work he was in,'' said acting Fire Chief Larry Garcia said.
``He couldn't be bested in terms of his willingness and his ability to do something to help you survive.''
Firefighters never reached Mrs. Price, who was trapped in her bedroom, Garcia said.
They had to cut short their rescue effort just before the roof caved in.
The woman's daughters escaped from a second-story bedroom by climbing down ladders put up on the side of the house by firefighters.
In the nation's capital, where the federal government's war on drugs is mapped out, young Washingtonians fighting over drugs were killing each other at a rate of more than one a day during 1988.
The District of Columbia's drug problems dramatize the two different Washingtons - the Capitol, the White House and other sites visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power.
There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn to the status and money that come from selling drugs.
In 1988, 371 persons had been killed in the nation's capital as of Dec. 30, far surpassing the previous high total of 287, set in 1969.
Police blame drugs - particularly the arrival of crack cocaine for about 60 percent of the slayings.
As recently as 1986, drug-related killings accounted for just one-third of the city's homicide total.
Although final population and homicide figures have yet to be compared, Washington and Detroit had the two highest per-capita murder rates in America in 1988, meaning the nation's capital could earn the dubious honor of being the nation's murder capital as well.
Ironically, the absence of organized crime in Washington may be pushing the murder total even higher.
Law enforcement officials note that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug market, there are fewer drug-related slayings.
``What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief Maurice T. Turner.
``They are just working for themselves.''
Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough battle for Turner and his 3,800 officers.
Earlier this year, police switched to .9mm semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on the street were outclassing the standard .38-caliber six-shot revolver officers have been carrying.
The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated weaponry.
Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, Turner called the district's streets ``something out of the Wild, Wild West.''
Officers will have their new guns by 1990.
And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects hasn't sated the city's appetite for narcotics.
A highly-touted anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than 46,000 arrests since its August, 1986, inception.
However, Turner has complained that the program, which sends swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's already-overcrowded jail and court systems.
For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according to Turner.
``A lot of these kids are high school dropouts, with few skills,'' Turner said.
``They can make up to a $1 million a year selling drugs.
What would you do?''
U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jay B. Stephens, who can prosecute both local and federal crimes, earlier this month announced that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on drug-related killings in the district.
Turner has also called on city officials to spend more money on drug education, prevention and treatment programs.
Currently, a three-week wait is common for persons wanting to enroll in the city's treatment centers.
What does the future hold?
Police hope that as markets are more firmly established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative, the murder rate will decrease.
``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an infusion of crack,'' Turner said.
``When crack arrived in other cities, like New York, murder rates went up there too.''
Yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates.
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year.
Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue's.
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner.
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days.
Nevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields "may blip up again before they blip down" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%.
Despite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds.
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion.
Typically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%. Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.
It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield.
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%. The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%. When it's time for their biannual powwow, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs.
Not this year.
The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.
The idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn't so rusty after all, that it's a good place for a company to expand.
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory.
For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge.
Champagne and dessert followed.
The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
The governor couldn't make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors.
Then, in the guests' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race.
After the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.
No dummies, the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor's name or two.
Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.
This time, it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away.
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation.
More than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.
But for now, they're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February.
Newsweek, trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers.
The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report.
Alan Spoon, recently named Newsweek president, said Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5% in January.
A full, four-color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980.
In mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Time's ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000.
U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates.
Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which awards space credits to advertisers on "renewal advertising."
The magazine will reward with "page bonuses" advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 in 1989 and $340,000 in 1990.
Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau.
"What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said Mr. Spoon.
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%. Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year.
U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%.
THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977.
That year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market.
The computers were crude by today's standards.
Apple II owners, for example, had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes.
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club.
In addition, the Apple II was an affordable $1,298.
Crude as they were, these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office.
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years.
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts.
There were many pioneer PC contributors.
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981.
Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs.
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone.
IBM, the world leader in computers, didn't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market.
Today, PC shipments annually total some $38.3 billion world-wide.
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said.
If the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that it's "too early to say" whether that will happen.
Coincident with the talks, the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch.
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July.
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million debt, which was lent to the country's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917.
Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization.
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value.
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act.
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program.
LSI Logic Corp. reported a surprise $35.7 million third-quarter net loss, including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand.
In September, the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $2 million to $3 million net loss for the third quarter.
But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations, citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques.
"Over the summer months, there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector, our primary market," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer.
"In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear."
As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and "make appropriate reductions" in operating expenses.
The $35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share.
Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share.
A year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share.
Revenue rose 42% to $133.7 million from $94 million.
The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.
Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, Calif., factory to a research and development facility.
A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force.
"This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned," said Michael Stark, chip analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co.
"I think the stock is dead money for a while."
Yesterday's announcement was made after markets closed.
U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer.
Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy.
The jury is still out on Ronald Reagan, but history is likely to regard him as an average to good president, according to some scholars of the presidency.
With little time left in Reagan's final term, The Associated Press interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists in history, political science and social psychology.
Their tentative verdict: Reagan will get high marks for his use of the White House pulpit to unite the country and will get credit for improving East-West relations even though Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev may have been more responsible for it than he.
``My view is that he will be viewed by the American people as an above-average president,'' said Thomas Cronin, a historian of the presidency at Colorado College who calls himself a moderate Democrat.
``I think the historians and biographers will treat him a little bit more harshly, still ranking him at least an average president but not as high as the American people now do or will.''
But Daniel Franklin, a professor of political science at Colgate University who is critical of many Reagan policies, said, ``I think, in the historical sense, somewhere down the road, that Reagan will be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of the problems that he has left us.''
If the economy turns sour in the wake of his administration's record budget and trade deficits, Reagan may go down in history like Calvin Coolidge as a president who failed to take action to stave off coming disaster.
Some scholars said Reagan's reputation will also suffer from scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless.
``I think probably in the short range reaction in the next five or 10 years, even liberal and radical historians will find something good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a kind of quality of Americanism and a sense of national unity and he projected that from the White House,'' said Herman Belz, a neo-conservative historian at the University of Maryland.
``Whether or not in the long run our relations with the Soviets will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall of 1988 under Ronald Reagan I don't know, but it would certainly look that way,'' said Vaughn Davis Bornet, professor emeritus of history at Southern Oregon State College and a self-described moderate Republican.
Edward W. Chester, a conservative historian at the University of Texas, said it is too early to evaluate Reagan.
But, echoing many of his academic colleagues, he said, ``The deficit does bother me.
The deficit does bother me.''
``I think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for a renewed sense of national pride,'' said Charles W. Dunn, a former Republican congressional aide who teaches political science at Clemson University and has written widely on the presidency.
Austin Ranney, chairman of the Department of Political Science at the University of California at Berkeley, said, ``On just the externalities of it, I think Reagan's presidency, with one huge `if,' will probably go down as one of the most successful ones certainly in this century and maybe ever.''
However, comparing Reagan with one of the predecessors the president most admires, Ranney also said that ``Reagan may go down in history pretty much the way Coolidge did'' if some economists' predictions of economic collapse come true.
``Coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by Hoover, a bum, but as a president whose do-nothing policies led to the huge crash of the early '30s that Hoover was the victim of,'' he said.
Dean Keith Simonton, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis who has devised a formula for predicting how history will rate presidents, said, ``When you put all the pros and all the cons in the equation, Ronald Reagan comes out as a slightly above average president.''
One of the ``pro'' factors for Reagan, said Simonton, is the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that he and Gorbachev have forged.
``He gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he didn't take the initiative for that,'' Simonton said.
``In all fairness, Gorbachev deserves more credit than he does,'' said Colorado College's Cronin.
``Still,'' said Southern Oregon's Bornet, ``Ronald Reagan stepped forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and that's going to be hard to erase, I'll tell you.''
Clemson's Dunn, similarly, argued, ``A good leader also must seize the opportunity, and Gorbachev offered an opportunity to play for high stakes in the international arena.
He seized that; he was not frozen in place by rigid ideology, and thus I think one has to give him credit.''
From Berkeley, Ranny said the relaxation of East-West tensions was the most important of Reagan's accomplishments in foreign policy.
``Now you might say that's because he got lucky and had Gorbachev there, and I wouldn't quarrel with that,'' he said.
``Nevertheless, it did happen.
And I think when historians look back at that, they will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most successful postwar presidents that we have had.''
Psychologist Simonton said one big factor working in Reagan's favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since Dwight Eisenhower to serve eight years.
``The longer you serve the more events happen that can be credited to you, whether or not you are responsible for them,'' he said.
``You make a thick chapter in the history of America under your name.''
Although Reagan recently pictured himself as the adversary of a ``Washington colony'' protecting special interests at the expense of ordinary citizens, some scholars argued that one of his own chief shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the outside.
Five things you can do for $15,000 or less:
1.Buy a new Chevrolet.
2.Take a Hawaiian vacation.
3.Send your child to a university.
4.Buy a diamond necklace.
5.Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan.
Americans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they don't think much about it.
But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise.
Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.
Like healthy regulatory capital.
A steady deposit base.
Performing loans.
At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.
That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth.
Don't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now!
Every day you delay, a savings institution's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse.
Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
Every $15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit!
Mr. Baris is a lawyer in New York.
Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush's clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain.
The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.
The administration's plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year.
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on clean-air legislation.
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation.
People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered later.
Mr. Bush's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000.
Although final details weren't available, sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president's proposal for a cap on utilities' sulfur-dioxide emissions.
That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth.
It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters.
In addition, it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country, sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.
The administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing.
Mr. Dingell's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.
It isn't clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acid-rain plan.
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns.
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships.
The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said.
"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.
Everything will be taken over by the new company," said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine.
Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities.
Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said.
Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company.
Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.
Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.
Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.
Uniformed men beat up Cecilio Aguilar beneath an avocado tree, marched him and two friends down a wooded path and pounded them to death with rifle butts, witnesses say.
Leftist guerrillas captured Francisco Diaz as he was searching for three wayward cows, took him away and shot him.
The killings are examples of the growing toll of politically motivated slayings in El Salvador in 1988 as both sides in a 9-year-old civil war grow frustrated with a stalemate.
The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office has counted 181 summary killings in the first 11 months of 1988, compared with 129 in all of 1987.
Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said during his homily Sunday that altogether 1,369 civilians, soldiers or leftist rebels were killed last year in military clashes, rightist death squad operations and car bombings or other terrorist acts.
The war has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives since it began.
``It is so hard to see any sort of light,'' said a church worker who has spent nearly two decades in Morazan, an eastern province divided between guerrillas and government forces.
``It's so disheartening because you had the feeling things were getting better.
And now you feel them going backward, getting worse,'' the worker said on condition he not be identified.
When the uniformed men had finished killing Cecilio, they went back to his house to demand food and his weapon.
His mother could give them only tortillas.
``They said he was a guerrilla.
But my son had no weapon, only a machete,'' said Dominga Aguilar.
In her one-room mud brick home, she recounted through sobs the events of Nov. 12, when men she described as government soldiers swept into this hamlet.
Francisco Diaz was the former mayor of another small town, Lolotique, 12 miles from Piedra He was searching for cows with his brother Dec. 6 when leftist guerrillas captured him, his wife said.
They killed him for what they said was his complicity in a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.
The cases in Lolotique and Piedra Luna, a village of a dozen households 90 miles east of San Salvador, are not unique.
Respect for human rights improved steadily from 1984 until 1988.
The early 1980s were a time of slaughter when soldiers and rightist death squads were blamed for the slayings of about 30,000 people.
The United States, which has provided more than $3 billion in aid this decade, told Salvadoran authorities in 1983 that support would dry up if the rights situation did not improve.
Salvadoran authorities say the government no longer has any ties with right-wing death squads.
The leftist guerrillas have killed eight mayors and 32 other civilians in 1988 for allegedly collaborating with the army.
The Catholic Legal Aid office blames the army for 90 summary executions of suspected guerrilla collaborators.
Death squads are blamed for 51 murders.
The slayings of Aguilar, 17, Hernan Benitez, 18 and Dolores Pineda, 24, devastated their families, the community council they all sat on and the village soccer team.
Benitez was the goalie, Aguilar a fullback and Pineda a midfielder.
Benitez died with his soccer shoes on.
``I won't play ever again,'' his mother, Amalia, quoted him as saying as he laced up the cleats before being taken away.
``He knew.
He lifted the dog's front paws and danced with him.
He kissed the baby and said, `This is it, Ma.
I'm saying goodbye,''' she said.
Those who took them away were government soldiers, six witnesses said.
Hernan's mother said the officer in charge repeatedly accused the family of setting corn aside for the guerrillas.
Arturo Rivera Damas, archbishop of San Salvador, also has blamed army troops for the Piedra Luna killings and called for an investigation.
Lt. Col. Oscar Leon Linares denied army responsibility.
He blamed the guerrillas, claiming they wanted to discredit the armed forces.
He said army records show no troops near Piedra Luna on Nov. 12.
He denied a request to see the records, saying they were classified.
He said the case is closed.
Aguilar's 15-year-old brother has been a guerrilla for a year, Mrs. Aguilar said.
Benitez's father was detained for four days in October, and - according to his family - he was severely beaten and accused of guerrilla sympathies.
The three young men, though perhaps not outright collaborators, maintained friendly relations with rebels who pass through regularly, villagers said.
The community council they sat on functions with tacit guerrilla approval.
When the guerrillas kill civilians, they usually announce it on their clandestine Radio Venceremos.
The radio announced Dec. 9 that Diaz, the former mayor, was found guilty of ``crimes against the people.''
He was the secretary-general of the governing Christian Democratic Party in Lolotique.
He had been kidnapped by the guerrillas for five months in 1985.
``We explained to him how mayors are tools for the implementation of the counterinsurgency plan ... but he did not obey, and continued implementing the plan in Lolotique,'' said the broadcast.
``He helped whomever he could,'' said his widow, Blanca, in their home.
The room where she sat contained a sort of shrine - a crucifix and her husband's photograph surrounded by flowers in coffee cans.
``Maybe they killed him for helping the community,'' she said, a tear tracking down her cheek.
When a U.S. ambassador sat down with a PLO delegation for the first official meeting in 13 years, Sweden scored a triumph for a foreign policy variously described as magnanimous or meddlesome.
For a small country, Sweden is engaged in other people's troubles to a surprising degree.
``Some people call it international meddling or giving unsolicited advice,'' said Pierre Schori, the Cabinet secretary who is the Foreign Ministry's No. 2 official.
But Sweden sees its foreign diplomacy as central to its own well-being.
``Our security has not only to do with our borders.
It also is affected by the international climate,'' Schori said.
Increasingly, neutral Sweden is being used as a communications channel for parties who can't talk to each other.
On Dec. 16, the same day the U.S. ended its formal boycott of the PLO, Sweden's ambassador to Syria, Rolf Gauffin, was instrumental in mediating the release of Peter Winkler, a Red Cross delegate who was kidnapped Nov. 17 by a Palestinian faction in Lebanon.
Sweden's approach to world affairs, sometimes criticized as moralistic and preaching, has created some ill feeling, particularly in Israel but also in the United States.
The late Prime Minister Olof Palme was blacklisted from the White House for his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War after he marched through Stockholm with North Vietnamese leaders.
``We believe strongly in human rights, international law and the resolution of conflicts,'' Schori said in an interview in his vaulted 18th century office.
``Our actions are motivated by a combination of self-interest and solidarity.''
The U.S.-PLO dialogue was a personal victory for Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, who worked in secret for nine months to nudge Palestinian Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat to meet U.S. conditions for ending its ban on contacts with his organization.
``The PLO success was the climax of a long process,'' Schori said.
``But the positions were blocked, and what was needed was a midwife.
Somebody had to take the initiative.
Sten Andersson saw that.''
Andersson, a wily politician with little foreign experience, came to the Foreign Ministry in 1985 after nearly 20 years as secretary of the dominant Social Democratic Party and three years as health minister.
He brought with him the typically Swedish approach that any problem is solvable by discussion among reasonable men.
Sweden, which allocates 1 percent of its gross national product to foreign aid, also has provided a pool of experienced diplomats for international service.
Bernt Carlsson was U.N. Commissioner for Namibia.
He died in Dec. 21 Pan Am plane crash in Scotland while on his way to New York to observe the signing of an agreement for Namibian independence from South African rule.
Jan Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, was tapped by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Sept. 1 to lead Iran-Iraq peace negotiations.
In less public roles, Swedish diplomats have been conduits for contacts between rival factions in Nicaragua and El Salvador, among others, Schori said.
Last year the Swedes persuaded Cuba to allow the Red Cross to visit prisoners in Cuban jails.
Sweden's international activity goes back a long way.
Prime Minister Karl Branting won the 1921 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the League of Nations.
It has contributed 55,000 men to U.N. peacekeeping forces, which were created by the U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, a Swede.
Count Folke Bernadotte, a member of Sweden's royal family, was the U.N.'s first martyr.
He was assassinated by Jewish extremists in pre-independence Palestine in 1948.
Four years earlier, diplomat Raoul Wallenberg distributed Swedish passports to Hungarian Jews threatened with deportation to Nazi death camps.
He was credited with saving 100,000 lives before Soviet forces arrested him at the close of the war and he disappeared.
The Soviets say he died in prison in 1947, but his family is convinced he is still alive.
Gunnar Jarring, appointed special U.N. emissary to the Middle East after the 1967 Six-Day War, earned a footnote in history as the inventor of shuttle diplomacy, though the credit went later to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Jarring's mission ended in failure.
Schori said the relaxation of U.S.-Soviet tension may usher in a less active period for Sweden.
``There's been a need for bridge-building.
Now it's changing,'' he said.
``We have no ambition to be mediators.
Where we have a contribution to make, we do all we can.
But I see this role declining in an era of detente.''
Libya has secretly started producing limited quantities of chemical weapons at a plant near Tripoli and has conducted trial runs of its production equipment, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
Libya claims the facility manufactures pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.
Until now, U.S. officials said Libya was on the verge of producing lethal gases but had not actually begun doing so.
``They have conducted test runs and have some limited production,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
A similar indication was given by State Department spokesman Charles Redman, who said that if foreign companies withheld further technical help from the Libyan chemical weapons facility, ``Libya would find it difficult to begin full production, and would not be able to sustain limited CW production.''
He declined to elaborate.
ABC-TV, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, reported Tuesday night that Libya has been moving material out of the plant in recent days, perhaps to clear away evidence before an international inspection.
There was a spill of toxic chemicals at the plant during an operational test run last summer, the Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions.
The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that few details were known about the spill.
The escalation of the U.S. campaign against Libya appears designed to bolster the American position at an upcoming international conference on chemical weapons scheduled to begin Jan. 7 in Paris.
The U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, plans to press participants to withhold help from Libya for the facility.
Attention has been focused on the facility near Rabtha, about 50 miles southwest of Tripoli, after President Reagan told an interviewer last month that a military attack on the plant had been discussed and added: ``That's a decision that has not been made yet.''
A statement by the official JANA news agency on Tuesday accused the United States of lying about the plant as an excuse to attack Libya and kill its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
The movement of a U.S. carrier group toward the Mediterranean on Tuesday in what the Pentagon said was a normal rotation of forces prompted speculation in Italy of an impending strike.
In Los Angeles, Bob Hall, an assistant White House press secretary accompanying President Reagan on a California vacation, declined comment on the reports other than to say, ``We have nothing new on the subject.''
Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, also declined to discuss the reports but denied that the carrier movement was tied to the situation in Libya.
``It's a standard deployment,'' Howard said.
The United States said it has shown West Germany, Italy, Japan and other allies convincing proof that the newly built facility is producing chemical weapons.
Italian, Japanese and West German companies were involved in the construction of several plants in the complex housing the alleged chemical weapons facility.
Japan has told the United States its companies were helping build a nearby metallurgical plant, but U.S. officials say that plant makes canisters.
``Big, big metal canisters,'' said one official.
``What are they for, for pills?''
added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He indicated the canisters were intended for use in conjunction with the chemical weapons.
But a spokesman for the West German government said authorities there ``had no indication or evidence to verify the American suspicions'' that German companies were involved in the construction of a chemical weapons plant.
Nonetheless, West German officials announced they were examining the records of one chemical company doing business in the complex, Imhausen-Chemie.
``We are confident that the West German government is taking the information we have provided very seriously, and is investigating fully,'' Redman said.
The United States, along with at least 20 other countries, also produce chemical weapons.
But Redman said that in Libya's case ``it does happen to be in the hands of a particularly irresponsible government.''
U.S. officials are concerned Libya make give the weapons to one of its surrogate terrorist groups.
The administration of President-elect Bush is expected to revive the moribund international talks in Geneva on a global ban of chemical weapons use.
Cuban President Fidel Castro has pledged the U.S. Catholic Conference he will free the remaining 225 prisoners the Havana government has recognized as political, the Washington Post said in its Wednesday editions.
The group of prisoners include 44 the Cuban government has previously described as too dangerous to release from jail, the paper said, citing an unidentified senior Cuban official and western diplomats.
The Catholic conference has been pressing since 1985 for the prisoners' release, the diplomats were quoted as saying.
Of the 476 prisoners on the government's roster of those who have faced political charges, about 225 remain in jail.
Some 250 were released during 1988.
The political prisoners the government has acknowledged include those named in a list of about 450 presented to Cuba in May 1988 by Cardinal John O'Connor of New York City, according to the Post.
During the summer, Castro said that everyone on that list would be freed except 44, whom he described as too dangerous.
The government has not admitted that anyone else among its approximately 30,000 prisoners is being held on political charges.
Castro says now he will free the 44 prisoners he originally rejected, on the condition they be granted visas to travel immediatly to the United States, the Post said a high-ranking Communist Party official confirmed.
Among those to be liberated are the last four of 64 plantados, prisoners who refused on principle to participate in rehabilitation programs or in some cases to wear jail uniforms, the Post said.
Some have been jailed since the first years after the 1959 revolution.
However, the Post said, it remained unclear whether all of the prisoners would be eligible to go to the United States.
At least 24 released last year were denied visas because of criminal histories, according to a list drawn up by Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
The victims of Agent Orange finally will get their compensatory payments in 1989, more than a decade after Vietnam veterans first sued the defoliant's makers and 16 years after the U.S. pullout from Indochina.
The first payments are expected to go out in March or April.
More than 64,000 applications have been mailed to veterans or their families, and 2,000 to 3,000 additional veterans applied before the Jan. 1 deadline for cash benefits that will average about $5,700.
The money for veteran's payments comes from a $170 million fund, part of the settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought in 1978.
The total settlement was $180 million, but the fund has grown to $240 million with interest.
Payments will be made to individuals, to families and to social service agencies that help Vietnam veterans, said Kenneth Feinberg, the court-appointed special master who helped settle the suit.
``My feelings are ones of frustration and relief,'' said Feinberg.
``Frustration because it took so long and relief because those who are entitled to the money will finally get it.''
The court has estimated that about 30,000 veterans and 18,000 survivor families will be eligible for the special benefits.
Early projections showed eligible veterans would receive an average total of about $5,700; the most anyone can expect to receive is $12,800.
``Even though it may not be enough money, what it does is begin the healing process,'' said Frank McCarthy, a veteran who was active in the litigation.
``These children, these families who have lost loved ones, these totally disabled veterans are the bottom line and we have to help them now.''
The federal lawsuit was brought in 1978 by veterans who claimed exposure to the chemical defoliant - sprayed over Southeast Asia during the 1960s by the U.S. military in an attempt to deprive Communist troops of crops and cover - caused cancer, birth defects in their children and other illnesses.
The herbicide contains the highly toxic chemical dioxin.
In 1984, hours before the trial was to start, the seven manufacturers of the chemical agreed to pay $180 million but denied liability for any injuries.
The money has been tied up since in legal challenges.
The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the last obstacle in June, and soon after, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein announced plans for dispersal of the money.
Weinstein, who presided over the case and continues to oversee the distribution, split the settlement fund.
The first component sets aside $170 million for the Agent Orange Veteran Payment Program, which will provide cash benefits to veterans considered totally disabled under Social Security guidelines and to the families of veterans whose deaths were linked to Agent Orange.
An additional $52 million was earmarked for the Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, which will distribute grants to social service agencies that serve Vietnam veterans and their families.
Of the remaining money, $5 million was distributed to Australian and New Zealand military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam, and $13 million went for attorneys' fees and other expenses.
The Jan 1. deadline does not affect veterans who later become aware of an Agent Orange-connected illness or succumb to such a disease.
Those claims can be filed until Dec. 31, 1994.
Aetna Life Insurance Co. was appointed to process the claims and set up a separate unit in Hartford, Conn., to administer the payment program, according to Bill Cotter, a consultant for the company.
He said Aetna already has received back 10,000 filled-out applications of the 64,000 sent out.
A toll-free telephone number drew more than 60,000 calls, he said.
``We have had so many different types of calls - the very angry veterans who are quite abusive on the phones, the very courteous who are pleased with the information and the veterans who have broken down and sobbed,'' he said.
The assistance program is headed by Dennis Rhoades, a Vietnam veteran who was director of the American Legion's National Economic Commission.
Rhoades said he is reviewing about 140 proposals from agencies seeking grants from the $52 million fund.
He expects to authorize the first grants in three to six months.
The Duke and Dutchess of York did not set a trend by naming their daughter Beatrice - at least not among parents who announced the birth of a child in the Times of London last year.
Alice and Charlotte were the most popular girls' first names chosen by those parents, says Helen Beard, the paper's social editor.
``The royal birth on Aug. 8 seems to have had no effect on the commoners' choice, at least among Times-reading parents,'' she wrote on Monday.
Lists of most popular names have become a favorite feature in the paper at this time each year.
One list - all-names - comprises the names that most often appear in cases where parents give their children two or more forenames.
The second list - first-names - comprises only the most popular choice of first forename chosen by parents.
Ms. Beard wrote: ``A total of 5,531 births were gazetted (in 1988), of whom 2,659 were girls and 2,872 were boys; (in 1987), out of a total of 5,477, boys were in a majority of 134.
``James again led both the first-name and the all-names leagues for boys.
Elizabeth was still way ahead in the girls' all-names list; but she failed even to obtain a place (among the top 10) in the first-name league, which is now jointly led by Alice (for the first time) and Charlotte.
``In the all-names leagues, Henry supplanted Christopher, while Rose, Alexandra and Lucy ousted Emma, Jane and Emily.
Katherine is back among the first names (out goes Rebecca). The list of boys' first names and their order are little changed, but Christopher, Robert and Henry squeezed out George and Benjamin.''
The Times has a daily circulation of about 450,000 in this country of 56 million people.
A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan, two of the world's most powerful financial companies.
The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan's once-cozy financial circles.
Not only are Japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work; increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion.
Already, the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments.
What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue.
Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund.
Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week.
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans.
Aside from Nomura's injured pride, the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government.
Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues, Wellington's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars (US$1.76 billion) to NZ$4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30.
With Japan's cash-flush banks aligned against it, though, raising money may be difficult.
Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan, bankers here say, but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market, they might be able to scuttle borrowings there, too.
New Zealand's finance minister, David Caygill, lashed out at such suggestions.
He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd., an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund, and wouldn't bail it out.
"It may very well be what the Japanese banks want," he told Radio New Zealand.
"I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests."
No less significant than the Japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries.
Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other.
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf, and relations have been at a flashpoint for months.
The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.
Meanwhile, the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks.
Nomura, the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field, and Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad, captain the opposing sides.
And their suspicions of each other run deep.
In the past year, both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses.
Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account, attracting the wrath of banks.
And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face.
The government says consumer prices rose 1,722 percent last year, the highest single-year mark in memory, and one economic forecasting firm predicts they will rise at more than three times that rate this year.
Economists say the rampant inflation is tied to a steep recession that weakened the economy following a growth rate of 8.5 percent in 1986 and of 6.7 percent in 1987.
Economy Minister Carlos Rivas said last week that early estimates indicate the economy shrank 8.4 percent in 1988.
``We are now paying the price for two years of growth,'' President Alan Garcia said recently.
The crisis has been marked by shortages of basic foods, such as milk, sugar and bread, and by increasing discontent among the 21 million Peruvians.
Political analysts say the flagging economy together with a relentless insurgency by leftist guerrillas are undermining Peru's frail democracy.
Rivas said a major cause of record inflation was government deficit spending to finance consumer subsidies.
The inflation figure of 158.3 percent set in 1985 had been the highest since Peru began keeping such records in 1920.
The National Statistics Institute, in its report Monday, said consumer prices in December increased by 40.9 percent compared with the month previous.
Garcia, a center-left populist, took office in July 1985 and used Peru's dollar reserves to subsidize imports needed for Peru's economic recovery.
Consumer prices surged early in 1988 after the reserves ran out and the government maintained its program of subsidies through heavy deficit spending, said economists, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The respected economics analysis firm Apoyo predicted inflation this year will hit at least 6,000 percent.
The Energy Department is proposing an $81 billion, 20-year program to clean up and modernize the nation's troubled nuclear weapons production complex.
``The cost of modernization and environmental restoration will require a significant increase in funding for the next two decades,'' said an Energy Department report for delivery to Congress.
The $81 billion total includes $52 billion to modernize outdated facilities, some of which are more than 30 years old, while $29 billion would go toward efforts to deal with radioactive and chemical contamination at many sites throughout the weapons complex.
The long-range plan would involve building new facilities in South Carolina and Idaho as well as phasing out weapons production activities in Washington state, Colorado and Ohio.
The Energy Department has refused to release any portions of the classified document, known as the ``2010 Report'' because it looks ahead as far as the 2010 fiscal year.
Gail Bradshaw, deputy chief spokesman for the department, said this week the department could not release the report's unclassified executive summary until it had received permission to do so from the National Security Council.
A copy of the summary was obtained by Morris News Service and made available to The Associated Press.
Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said Dec. 22 the next administration faces ``hard choices'' in dealing with the problems of the nuclear weapons complex.
He told a National Press Club audience that cannibalization of some warheads to build or upgrade others is something ``we must look at to keep our options open.''
But Herrington added, ``I do not anticipate the need'' to resort to such methods.
The possibility of cannibalizing warheads was raised after safety and equipment problems closed the nation's three reactors for producing tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be regularly replenished to keep warheads at peak explosive power.
Herrington has said it will be spring or summer before any of the three reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., can be restarted.
The 2010 Report raises questions about whether the Savannah River reactors can be brought back to efficient production of tritium.
It noted that ``all three reactors are shut down for safety system improvements and are not expected to be fully operational until late 1989.
Despite these improvements and increasingly extensive maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable production efficiencies.''
Other key findings of the report:
->The nuclear weapons complex must be modernized so nuclear deterrence can continue to be a vital element of U.S. security policy.
->Operations of the complex will require environmental, safety and health remedial actions and a program to ensure that its operations comply with applicable laws, standards and regulations.
->Much of the nuclear weapons complex was constructed more than 30 years ago, and many facilities are approaching the end of their useful lives.
->Full funding for the modernization and environmental cleanup effort will probably be difficult to achieve, in view of competition with other programs.
The report said that while the budget for fiscal 1990 will be ``generally consistent'' with the plan, accomplishing all recommendations on schedule probably will require more resources than are now expected to be available in subsequent years.
->``Major environmental restoration'' will be required at the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash., and the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio, when nuclear weapons activities there are either relocated or terminated.
As an interim measure, certain upgrade steps will be required at the Rocky Flats Plant to maintain operations ``at an acceptable level of risk'' while the relocated facilities are being constructed.
->New production reactors are slated for the Savannah River Plant and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
DOE has proposed building a heavy water reactor at Savannah River and a gas->cooled reactor at the Idaho facility.
->Both the administration and Congress recognize the need for the modernization and cleanup program, and ``expeditious implementation'' of the proposed plan is recommended, the report summary said. 1989 has begun for Soviets with Mikhail S. Gorbachev warning them not to expect ``manna from heaven'' and a multitude of signs - from barren shop shelves to astrology - heralding another hard year in the building of communism.
Year IV of ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's driv to refashion Soviet economy and society, will bring the first national multicandidate elections in decades, part of the his campaign for ``democratization,'' and continued streamlining in the economy.
But at the dawn of the year, as Moscow shivered in subzero cold, such common items as detergent, bath soap, chickens, coffee, toothpaste, sugar, yeast and candy were hard to find or completely absent from state-run stores.
On Sunday the Kremlin announced an export ban on goods ranging from caviar to children's shoes, an apparent attempt to hoard chronically scarce Soviet-made products for Soviet consumers.
In his televised New Year's Eve message, Gorbachev told his 285 million countrymen that improvements in their lives would be gradual at best in the coming months, and that there would be no miracles.
``It is wrong to think, comrades, that somebody will solve our problems for us and that everything around us will change at the wave of a magic wand, with the chime of the clock on New Year's Eve,'' he said.
``We see now that it is essential to act with greater resoluteness,'' said Gorbachev, Soviet leader since March 1985.
``We are not awaiting and we are not promising manna from heaven, knowing well that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy, and our road is difficult.''
For some, that message may have seemed distressingly like Gorbachev's forecast at the beginning of 1988, when he said ``immense and hard work'' lay ahead in his drive for economic change.
The multibillion-ruble cost of rebuilding areas of northwestern Armenia shattered by the Dec. 7 earthquake also will cause shortages in the economy, for example in building materials, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has said.
On Jan. 1, all 48,000 state-run enterprises in the nation were put on a pay-their-own-way basis, meaning they are deprived of government subsidies and forced to find ways to generate enough revenue to meet costs and payroll.
For Soviet managers accustomed to top-heavy centralized controls, which severely limited their initiative but also freed them from many decision-making responsibilities, ``self-accounting'' is a mixed blessing.
They are free to negotiate contracts and pursue the once-forbidden goal of making a profit, but also in theory may face bankruptcy if they fail.
The nation's 130 million workers, too, can theoretically earn more if they produce more, but run the risk of layoffs if their factory trims its labor force to cut costs.
According to Radio Moscow, enterprises that account for 60 percent of Soviet industrial output have been on ``self-accounting'' since January 1988.
The jury is still out, however, on whether they have gained much freedom.
One Soviet economist, Nikolai Shmelov, has said government bureaucrats still exercise effective control over some branches of the economy by issuing them 80 percent and more of their orders they must fill.
In March, voters will be called to elect the members of a new Council of People's Deputies that will choose their membership of their national parliament and name a head of state with increased powers.
The sole candidate for the new presidential post is widely expected to be the 57-year-old Gorbachev himself, posing further questions about how democratic the Kremlin's ``democratization'' process can or will be.
At lower levels, however, voters will be able to choose from more than one candidate, in contrast to past practice, when electoral nominees were selected according to social status, age and sex to fill quotas fixed in Moscow.
1989 will also bring uncertainty in international relations, as the Kremlin seeks a working relationship with a new U.S. president and decides whether to complete its now-frozen military withdrawal from Afghanistan in time to meet a U.N.-brokered Feb. 15 deadline.
Shortly before Gorbachev went on TV with his New Year's message, the official news agency Tass transmitted new year's greetings to English-language subscribers along with the image of a snake, a reminder that according to Oriental astrology, 1989 is the Year of the Snake.
Some Soviets, in humor or in earnest, note that past such years in the 12-year Oriental cycle have been the occasion of tragic or cataclysmic happenings in their homeland, and predict an eventful 1989.
In 1905, there was an abortive anti-czarist revolution.
In 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution brought the Communists to power.
In 1929, dictator Josef V. Stalin began the bloody campaign to snuff out private farming.
In 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union.
And in 1953, Stalin died, and was succeeded by Nikita S. Khrushchev.
The weather continues to be the biggest question mark for Agriculture Department economists trying to figure out where U.S. farm production may be headed in 1989.
For example, most analysts say the historical record shows little chance that the devastating drought of 1988 - which shriveled crop production by 30 percent - will repeat this year.
But the drought's effects are still apparent in much of the land, where subsoil moisture has yet to recover.
And even long-shot odds of the 1988 heat and drought repeating are causing USDA economists a few nightmares.
The uncertainties are important as the economists look at all crop prospects, but they are particularly vital for feed grains and how this year's output might affect livestock producers.
Dave Hull of the department's Economic Research Service says in the January-February issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine the acreage of corn and other feed grains is expected to increase in 1989 because of a relaxation in the government's land-idling requirements.
The program changes, he said, could add 8 million to 10 million acres to this year's corn plantings.
In all, the corn area for harvest next fall could be in the range of 67 million to 69 million acres, compared with an estimated 56.7 million harvested in 1988.
Last year's corn production was 4.67 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion in 1987 and 8.25 billion in 1986.
Yields averaged 82.3 bushels per harvested acre, compared with more than 119 bushels per acre in each of the two previous years.
``Many estimates of 1989 corn yields range from 110 to 115 bushels per acre, although these forecasts may be weighting the 1988 disaster and potential weather problems a bit too heavily,'' Hull said.
``If weather cooperates (in 1989), yields of 120 bushels per acre are not out of the question, considering long-term trend increases of more than 2 bushels per year.''
If that happens, he said, farmers could harvest between 7.7 billion and 8.3 billion bushels of corn next fall.
Hull said that if 1989 corn production is at the low side of these projections farmers probably would see some decline in market prices in the 1989-90 season.
The agency currently projects corn prices will average $2.40 to $2.80 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year that began last Sept. 1.
But if this year's harvest is at the higher end of the projection range, the price decline would be much sharper as U.S. stockpiles once again start to rebuild.
Hull said prices then could drop in 1989-90 to near the government's price support loan rate of $1.65 per bushel.
``If yields return to normal, 1989-90 production of barley, oats and sorghum also is likely to rebound,'' he said.
``Stocks of barley and oats would tend to build modestly if production returns to normal, and prices probably will fall.''
Soghum output ``is likely to rebound'' this year if yields are normal, although total use may continue to exceed production, Hull said.
Prices will probably continue to be pegged to roughly 90 percent of corn prices.
Handcuffed by public refusal to accept a speed limit on the autobahns, West German lawmakers have issued a compromise order to curb rising accident rates.
It is now the law that drivers must be polite.
Aggression in the form of dangerously high speeds and daredevil maneuvers accounted for many of the 400,000 injury-causing accidents in West Germany in 1988, according to police and automobile club statistics.
The revised rules that took effect Sunday include a prohibition against blinking headlights to pressure slower drivers to move to the right, as well as a finder's-keeper's policy on parking spaces, which are at a premium in most cities.
A nation renowned for its fast cars and frustrated drivers, West Germany has more traffic volume than any nation in Europe.
It also suffers the continent's highest injury-accident rate.
Fatal accidents - about 8,000 last year - have been considerably reduced in the past 10 years.
But the number of collisions rose by more than 10 percent in 1988 and moving violations were up by 28 percent over 1987.
Recent mild winters, coupled with cheaper gas prices due to a strong West German mark, have intensified the problem of too many cars traveling too fast on too few roads.
``The problem is that drivers are becoming increasingly aggressive on the highways, borrowing the idea from Americans that time is money,'' said Andreas Zimmermann, regional traffic division chief for ADAC, West Germany's largest automobile club.
The new ``Intelligent Use of the Streets'' legislation aims to diffuse some of the aggression by punishing drivers for infractions that until now have been considered impolite but not illegal.
The more than 100 minor revisions to the 1971 driving code are seen as a token of consolation for the outnumbered advocates of speed limits and environmental protection.
Public opinion polls have shown the vast majority of West German drivers favor a retention of the status quo - no speed limits at all.
They have rallied under the cry of ``Free Ways for Free Folks'' and through the powerful car industry and auto club lobbies fought off all attempts to cool their engines.
More than 1 million of the 28 million registered automobiles are capable of sustained speeds exceeding 125 mph, according to the ADAC, which is the world's second-largest auto club after the AAA in the United States.
Some politicians of the opposition Social Democrat party and the environmentalist Greens annually have put forward measures to establish a limit of 60 mph, but have been defeated by the dominant Christian Democrats and members of their own parties concerned about voter reaction.
Short of forcing drivers to slow down, the new laws require them to cease the widespread practice of using headlights and blinkers to pressure slower cars into moving out of their way.
Tailgating also has been outlawed, as well as passing too closely - a favorite punishment meted out by drivers miffed at having to change lanes to get by a slower car.
Truck drivers hauling dangerous cargo must pull into the nearest parking turnout when visibility drops to less than 165 feet because of fog, snow or rain.
Vehicles long have been prohibited from passing on the right, but the code revision makes the offense one that can damage a driver's record and eventually lead to license revocation.
Many drivers argue that despite the law, German practice on a three-lane autobahn dictates that slower cars use the right lane, fast cars the left and the middle lane is to remain open for passing from both sides.
Some of the more controversial and less-enforceable rules govern parking, including a requirement that the first car in a line of autos circling for a free space has claim to the next open spot - even if the driver has already passed it by.
Drivers are also required to activate their warning blinkers as soon as they see a traffic backup on an autobahn, with the aim of preventing the kind of multiple smashups that often occur in the fog or when backups are obscured by a rise or turn in the road.
Dieter Schulte, parliamentary secretary for the federal Transport Ministry and a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat Party, said more than $230 million will be invested in improving signs and roads as part of the new legal changes.
``Not only will these changes reduce the hazards from backups and passing, but they will also save energy and reduce environmental problems like noise and exhaust,'' Schulte said.
Others argue, however, that drivers will begin to depend on the new signs to warn them of road-blocking hazards ahead and drive even faster when no warnings are visible.
``With the best intentions, the changes may have negative consequences for safety and the environment,'' Zimmerman conceded.
Some of the new rules, irreverently referred to as ``the Polite Driving Act,'' are virtually unenforceable, such as requiring drivers to alert one another about hazards they themselves may not react to in time.
But the regulations are expected to deter some of the aggressive practices because violations will count against a driver's record.
West German drivers are not required to renew their licenses once they have passed initial tests and a two-year probation period, unless they've accumulated a considerable series of citations in a short period.
The point system differentiates between character offenses and accidents, ascribing a higher penalty for drunken driving than for killing a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
Points also are recorded for offenses such as misuse of blinkers or following too closely, previously punishable only by fines.
The success of the new system will depend heavily on the driving public, which to date has shown little interest or understanding of the revisions.
Drivers questioned at gas stations over the New Year's weekend expressed amusement over the effort to get them to mind their manners.
``Sure I'll be polite,'' promised one BMW driver who gave his name only as Rudolf.
``As long as the trucks and the timid stay out of the left lane.''
West Germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1, 1991, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said.
He said the government will also repeal the 1% transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies.
The announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax, which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the European Community at the end of 1992.
The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers, especially London, where trading transactions isn't taxed.
The tax has raised less than one billion marks ($545.3 million) annually in recent years, but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns.
In the interview, Mr. Haussmann didn't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears.
The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right coalition loses the elections in December 1990.
The head trader of Chemical Banking Corp. 's interest-rate options group has left the company, following valuation errors that resulted in a $33 million charge against its third-quarter results.
Chemical said Steven Edelson resigned recently, but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced.
Mr. Edelson couldn't be reached for comment.
A separate inquiry by Chemical cleared Mr. Edelson of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a New York money broker.
That inquiry hasn't resolved similar allegations involving another Chemical options trader.
In other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit:
-- Chemical named James Kennedy, a trader in swaps contracts for the bank, to assume Mr. Edelson's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products, including swaps and interest-rate options.
-- Lee Wakeman, vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess, resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at Continental Bank in Chicago.
Mr. Wakeman, whom Chemical tried to keep, didn't return calls for comment.
Separately, Chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on forward-rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in Frankfurt, West Germany.
A Chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was "not material" and that no personnel changes were made as a result.
The spokeswoman said the Frankfurt situation was "totally different" from problems in the interest-rate options unit.
According to individuals familiar with the situation, the Frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward-rate agreements that failed to envision an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates.
While the incidents involving interest-rate options and forward-rate agreements are unrelated, some observers say they echo a 1987 incident in which Bankers Trust New York Corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $80 million.
These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions.
In an interest-rate options contract, a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period.
In a forward-rate agreement, a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction.
Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss, in particular, may have resulted more from Chemical's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem.
Started three years ago, Chemical's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field.
From 1987 to 1988, the value of Chemical's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to $37 billion from $17 billion.
More importantly, the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2-to-1.
With such a lopsided book of options, traders say, Chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions.
The Chemical spokeswoman said the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls.
"We consider our internal controls to have worked well," she said, adding that some procedures have been strengthened.
Its valuation methodologies, she said, "are recognized as some of the best on the Street.
Not a lot was needed to be done."
Farm prices in October edged up 0.7% from September as raw milk prices continued their rise, the Agriculture Department said.
Milk sold to the nation's dairy plants and dealers averaged $14.50 for each hundred pounds, up 50 cents from September and up $1.50 from October 1988, the department said.
Commercial vegetables, led by lettuce and tomatoes, rose 19% in October; oranges and other fruits rose 5%.
Broiler prices fell 6.5 cents in October to 30.6 cents a pound, while turkey prices rose 1.2 cents a pound to 38.5 cents.
Egg prices averaged 64.2 cents a dozen, down 0.2 cent from September.
Hogs rose $3.40 to $46.80 a hundredweight in October, while beef cattle slipped 80 cents to $67.40 for each hundred pounds and calves dropped 90 cents to $90.20.
Soybeans averaged $5.28 a bushel, down 42 cents from September; corn averaged $2.20, down seven cents, and sorghum grain averaged $3.61 for each hundred pounds, down 19 cents, according to the department.
Sea Containers Ltd., in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid, said it will sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece.
Together with the 3.6 million shares currently controlled by management, subsidiaries and directors, the completed tender offer would give Sea Containers a controlling stake.
Describing itself as "asset rich," Sea Containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports, various ferries, ferry services, containers, and other investments.
Of the proceeds, $500 million will be used to fund its tender offer.
Sea Containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than $500 million.
The company, which has 13.8 million common shares outstanding, said in mid-June that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns.
In late May, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC, launched a $50-a-share, or $777 million, tender offer for the Hamilton, Bermuda-based Sea Containers.
In mid-August, the companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple Holdings Ltd., sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million.
Officials for Temple declined to comment.
News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers' shares up $1 to $62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Walter Kirchberger, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that offering holders a higher, $70-a-share price is "a fairly effective method of blocking" the Stena-Tiphook bid.
Michael Carstens, an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day, added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses.
For holders who decide not to tender their shares, Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $25, plus a cash dividend on the common stock.
The company said its directors, management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and won't tender any of their shares under the offer.
Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares.
That injunction resulted from litigation between Temple and Sea Containers last May.
The company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about Nov. 27.
Sea Containers will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer.
Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. will sell its contract-drilling business, and took a $50.9 million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale.
The New Orleans oil and gas exploration and diving operations company added that it doesn't expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring.
In the third quarter, the company, which is 61%-owned by Murphy Oil Corp. of Arkansas, had a net loss of $46.9 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with a restated loss of $9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago.
The latest period had profit from continuing operations of $4 million.
Revenue gained 13% to $77.3 million from $68.5 million.
Ocean Drilling said it will offer 15% to 20% of the contract-drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future.
It has long been rumored that Ocean Drilling would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business.
Ocean Drilling said it won't hold any shares of the new company after the restructuring.
Curbing future use of chemical weapons, not judging events in the past, is the purpose of a meeting of more than 140 countries beginning this weekend, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Wednesday.
But the United States is widely expected to make an issue of its allegations that Libya has built a large chemical weapons plant.
The conference, opening Saturday, follows the downing of two Libyan jet fighters by U.S. Navy planes on Wednesday.
The conference also may become a forum for disputes between Iran and Iraq, following Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the eight-year Persian Gulf war.
Iraq said it used chemical weapons after Iran did, but Iran has denied using them.
Speaking at a news conference, Dumas said France hopes the five-day conference ``will not deviate from its agenda'' after the incident.
He also said the meeting should avoid reviewing past chemical weapons deployment.
``The Paris conference must not judge past acts,'' Dumas said.
The aim of the conference is to reaffirm the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of chemical weapons and give impetus to negotiations in Geneva on a universal ban on use and production of chemical arms.
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, will attend the conference, U.N. officials said.
William Burns, the U.S. arms control director, told reporters in Washington on Wednesday that the American delegation will focus on trying to strengthen the secretary-general's authority to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use and authorize the U.N. General Assembly or Security Council to impose sanctions.
But Burns said this could be difficult since all actions at the conference will be taken by consensus.
This means a single participant, such as Libya, could hold off an overwhelming majority.
The U.S. government accuses Libya of having built a chemical weapons plant in the desert town of Rabta, 35 miles south of its capital, Tripoli.
President Reagan last month said a military strike on the plant was under consideration.
Libya says the plant in question produces pharmaceuticals.
West German radio quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the West German ambassador in Tripoli met Wednesday with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to discuss ways for an international commission to inspect the Rabta plant.
U.S. officials have said they suspect that a West German company helped build the chemical plant.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's foreign minister, told reporters in Bonn before the attack that his government was investigating the firm Imhausen-Chemie, but that it had no independent verification of the U.S. claims that it supplied Libya with materials for the plant.
Britain's Foreign Office said Wednesday night it had independent information confirming the plant was built to produce chemical weapons.
It was Britain's first comment on the U.S. allegations.
On Wednesday, two American F-14s shot down two Libyan jet fighters.
U.S. government officials said the Navy jets were conducting routine operations and had been threatened.
U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci denied the action was related to the earlier accusation concerning the chemical weapons plant.
Dumas said it was too soon for all the facts on the air skirmish to be known and that France awaited the ``Libyan version'' of the events.
Dumas said France did not have enough information to decide whether the Libyan plant was capable of producing chemical weapons.
The conference was formally proposed by President Reagan during his September address to the U.N. General Assembly.
Cuban President Fidel Castro on Wednesday said the first of 3,000 Cuban troops in Angola will return home Tuesday, the official Prensa Latina news agency reported.
Castro also warned that a plan to cut the number of U.N. peacekeeping troops in neighboring Namibia would permit South Africa to install a puppet government in that country, also known as South-West Africa.
``We will fulfill our obligations before the first of April,'' Castro said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
He was referring to the deadline for the pullout of the first 3,000 Cuban troops from Angola under a U.S.-brokered peace accord.
Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed a treaty Dec. 22 calling for the withdrawal of the 50,000-strong Cuban force from Angola within 30 months, half of them by Nov. 1.
Castro said a proposal to reduce the size of a U.N. peacekeeping force in Namibia from 7,500 to 3,000 troops would enable South Africa to maintain a powerbroker's role in Namibia and complicate the Cuban pullout from Angola.
``Difficulties have arisen'' in enacting the accord ``for the independence of Namibia, for which SWAPO has fought many years, spilling the blood of many of its combatants,'' Castro said, referring to the acronym for the South-West African Peoples Organization nationalist movement.
``Taking into account the growth of the South African forces ... in Namibia, the reduced number of (U.N.) troops could not guarantee these goals and would benefit South African plans to install a titular government in the country,'' Castro declared.
He said Cuba had made its concerns known to the U.N. Security Council.
Castro's complaints echoed those made by Sam Nujoma, leader of SWAPO, earlier Wednesday in Havana, the Cuban capital.
Castro suggested that other African nations, including Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, contribute troops to the U.N. force, Prensa Latina said.
Cuba sent troops to Angola in 1975 to help the Marxist government fight invading South African troops and U.S.-backed rebels of the right-wing National Union of the Total Independence of Angola, called UNITA.
Florence Ryder, chairman of the board of the Times Journal Co. which publishes the Army Times and other suburban Journal newspapers, died of a heart attack Wednesday at her home here.
She was 88.
Mrs. Ryder was the widow of Melvin Ryder, who in 1940 founded the Army Times, and she had been in the management of the company from its inception.
She had been chairman of the board since he died in 1979.
The company, which became the Times Journal Co. in 1984, now includes five suburban daily newspapers in the Washington area: the Montgomery, Prince George's, Fairfax, Arlington and Alexandria Journals, with a combined circulation of 150,000.
It also includes The Prince William Journal, a weekly with a circulation of 26,000, and six semi-weekly newspapers in the suburban San Diego area.
It is the largest publisher of military newspapers in the country with the weeklies, Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force Times, Federal Times and Defense News, and the monthly magazine, Military Market.
Mrs. Ryder, a native of Bedford, Ohio, moved to the Washington area in the 1930s after her first husband, William Donnelly, died in the late 1920s.
Survivors include three children of her first marriage, William Donnelly, Richard Donnelly and Sister Ann Donnelly, all of Washington; three daughters of her second marriage, Susan Skaggs of West Chester, Pa., Mary Jane Belber and Milly Ryder, both of Washsington; 16 grandchildren and nine great grandchidren.
U.S. Navy jet fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23 jets Wednesday after the Americans were approached at high speed in what Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci called ``a hostile manner'' in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea.
Carlucci said the two American F-14 Tomcat jets acted solely in self-defense.
Based on preliminary reports, the Soviet-built Libyan jets activated their weapon-targeting radar before the U.S. jets opened fire with their air-to-air missiles, he said.
Carlucci denied that the jets, assigned to the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, were airborne to participate in a military strike on a disputed chemical weapons production plant inside Libya.
President Reagan now oppposes a U.S. military strike against the plant because it would cause an international furor that might harm other U.S. interests, the Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions.
Carlucci said the carrier was only crossing the Mediterranean toward a port call and conducting routine operations when the incident occurred at midday local time, about 5 a.m. EST.
The U.S. planes, each carrying two crewmen, returned without incident to their carrier and were then flown to Naples, Italy, for debriefing, Carlucci said.
The fate of the two Libyan pilots remained unclear, although he said ``two parachutes were sighted'' and a rescue helicopter was later seen in the area.
It was the first military confrontation between the United States and Libya since a U.S. bombing raid over Tripoli in 1986.
That raid came after the Reagan administration said it had conclusive evidence that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was behind a terrorist bombing attack in West Germany.
Reagan, on vacation in Los Angeles, was awakened about an hour after the downing and told of the incident by Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, his national security adviser, in a phone call, said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
The spokesman said he had no information on Reagan's reaction, except to say that the president ``considers the incident closed.''
In Washington at a Pentagon briefing, Carlucci echoed that: ``We now consider this matter closed.''
Libya's Foreign Ministry called it a ``premeditated attack'' by U.S. forces and said it would seek an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
President-elect Bush was told of the incident by phone at 6 a.m. Wednesday by the White House situation room, according to spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
``He's being kept informed'' throughout the day, she added.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the U.S. jets were acting defensively and the Libyan planes ``had maneuvered themselves into a position of attack - and they did it on two occasions.''
``That violates the rules of engagement that we have common understanding on in the international environment,'' Nunn said.
``You cannot, in this day and time and modern technology, wait until another plane has fired in order to defend yourself.
It's too late then.''
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the downing appeared to be ``self-defense - pure and simple.''
Gadhafi ``never learns,'' Dole said.
``Maybe this time he will finally get it straight: Whenever he threatens American forces, we will defend ourselves.''
Carlucci said the Libyan jets were ``shot down in self-defense by American F-14s with air-to-air missiles.''
The defense secretary said the MiGs ``were detected shortly after they left Al Bumbah'' airfield and were tracked.
The U.S. pilots, he added, ``maneuvered to avoid the closing aircraft.
They changed speed, altitude and direction.
``The Libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner.
At about 14 miles, the U.S. section leader decided his aircraft was in jeopardy and they could wait no longer.
One MiG-23 was shot down with a Sparrow missile.
The second MiG was shot down by a Sidewinder missile at six miles.''
The incident occurred well off the Libyan coast in international airspace, Carlucci said.
The aircraft carrier was about 127 miles north of Tobruk, Libya, while the two F-14s were about 70 miles north of the coast.
A Navy E-2C Hawkeye radar surveillance plane was airborne with the two Tomcat fighters and monitored the action, said one Pentagon official who asked not to be identified.
``It was all routine, until these guys (the Libyans) took off and headed straight for the F-14s,'' the source added.
``Based on our current information ... the (U.S.) pilots descended in altitude from approximately 15,000 feet to 4,000 feet and they took some five different evasive actions,'' Carlucci said.
``Each time, the Libyan aircraft sought to put their nose on our aircraft.
They also accelerated.
So the hostile intent seems to be fairly clear,'' he said.
Carlucci said there was ``some preliminary information that radars were turned on.''
In Rome, Libya's ambassador to Italy, Abdel Rahman Shalgam, called Wednesday's incident ``a unilateral act'' and a dangerous action.
He declined to say how Libya would respond.
The Libyan Foreign Ministry said that as ``Libyan reconnaissance aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters, U.S. aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them down.''
Libya's official JANA news agency said the Foreign Ministry ordered its United Nations representative to ``present an urgent complaint to the Security Council concerning the aggression perpetrated by the U.S.A. against two Libyan reconnaissance planes ... and to demand the holding of an urgent Security Council meeting on this subject.''
Last month, in a television interview, Reagan said administration officials had debated a military attack on a newly constructed plant that Libya is preparing to produce chemical weapons, but added: ``That is a decision that has not been made yet.''
Libya claims the plant will make pharmaceuticals, and Gadhafi has charged the United States is using the allegations of chemical weapon production as a pretext to attack his country.
Carlucci insisted Wednesday the Kennedy and its air wing had no designs on the chemical weapons plant.
``This has nothing whatsoever to do with all the speculation, and if I may say, excessive speculation, that has existed'' on the chemical plant, Carlucci said.
``If you were going to make an attack on the chemical plant, you would not position your carrier some 600 miles away.
I think that's self evident.''
Two masked men claiming to be Red Brigades terrorists shot and wounded the assistant director of a prison after trying to seize him, authorities said.
Egidio de Luca was returning to his home near Tivoli, about 30 miles northeast of Rome, on Tuesday night the two men blocked his path, police said.
The assailants, armed with pistols, identified themselves as members of the ``New Red Brigades of the Fighting Communist Party'' and tried to grab de Luca, they said.
When he reached for his gun, the men shot him in the thigh, police said.
A bodyguard following de Luca then started shooting at the assailants, who fled to a nearby car and escaped.
De Luca was hospitalized in Tivoli in serious condition, police said.
The Red Brigades, a collection of far-left terrorist groups, used killing, kidnapping and ``knee-capping'' - shooting someone in the knee - to try to destroy confidence in the Italian state during the 1970s and early 1980s.
The group has greatly diminished in size in recent years.
The Fighting Communist Party is a military wing of the Red Brigades and, according to the Italian news agency AGI, the New Red Brigades is a faction with about 100 members, most of them very young.
De Luca is assistant director of Rome's Rebibbia prison, which holds 1,300 people and includes a maximum-security section that holds terrorists, among others.
De Luca is responsible for a section with people accused of common crimes, AGI said.
Employees of the prison in the past have been victims of Red Brigades attacks.
De Luca's home was firebombed in 1980, when he was employed at the prisons office of the Justice Ministry, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
The last Red Brigades killing was in April, when Sen. Roberto Ruffilli was shot near his home in Forli in northern Italy.
Director Steven Spielberg, a long-time lover of animated cartoons, is joining forces with Warner Bros. for a new television version of Warner's famous ``Merrie Melodies,'' to be called ``Tiny Tunes.''
``These will be offspring of the famous Warner Bros. cartoons, such as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat,'' Spielberg said at a news conference Wednesday.
``But I don't know if they will be actually sons and daughters.
I'm not quite sure how reproduction works in `Tunes.' ''
``Tiny Tunes'' will be produced jointly by Spielberg and Warner Bros. and will be distributed for syndicated television by Lorimar Telepictures Corp. for the fall season of 1990.
The initial order under the two-year contract is for 65 episodes.
Terry Semel, president and chief operating officer of Warner Bros. Inc., said the project had been in development for several years with Spielberg, who has produced such animated features as ``An American Tail'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
``We at Warner's had been talking about doing something for a long time with our animated characters,'' Semel said.
``This young man kept popping in and out and telling us, `I want to do something with your cartoons.'
That guy was Steven Spielberg.''
Spielberg said he can't draw or paint, but is a great admirer of cartoons, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s.
``My favorites were those from Warner Bros. because they were sassy and never took any guff from anybody,'' Spielberg said.
``Our characters will be derived from those cartoons.
They're going to be tinier versions of Porky Pig and Sylvester and Tweety.''
Spielberg promised there would be no violence in the half-hour episodes, and that they wouldn't have the chase scenes that are a staple of many cartoon shows.
Eastern Europeans searching each other's stores for bargains in Soviet caviar, Czech auto parts and Bulgarian sportswear have set off an unprecedented ``customs war'' in the communist bloc.
The new Soviet freedom to travel and relaxations on travel throughout much of Eastern Europe lie behind the East's trade skirmishes and new trends in bargain hunting both east and west.
The first salvo was fired by Czechoslovakia, which on Nov. 15 gave its Warsaw Pact allies only 24 hours notice that it was banning the export of 80 consumer items, including toilet paper, children's clothes, cars and car parts, bananas and chocolate.
Czechoslovak officials explained the sudden action with the need to protect their own consumers, who are used to a relatively cozy standard of living that the Prague government is finding harder to maintain as the economy stagnates.
East Germany, whose 17 million citizens frequently journey to Czechoslovakia as the only nation they can visit without a visa, swiftly fired back a reply.
On Nov. 18, it banned the export of items ranging from curtains to maps - both popular purchases for Czechoslovaks crossing into East Germany.
Poland was so enraged by the Czechoslovak restrictions that it took the unusual step of summoning Czechoslovakia's ranking consular official to the Foreign Ministry in Warsaw to explain the new customs restrictions.
Poles, who have the reputation in Eastern Europe of being the region's greatest black market traders, grumbled about five-hour delays at the Czechoslovak border as guards searched trains for hidden supplies of fruit, meat and tea that can no longer be taken out of the country.
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo noted, meanwhile, that in the first nine months of 1988, six Poles, four East Germans and three Hungarians visited Czechoslovakia for every Czech or Slovak going to those nations.
The Soviet Union took a little longer to react to Czechoslovakia's sudden steps, waiting until last weekend to announce a ban from February on the export of caviar, coffee, children's clothes and electrical goods.
Black market dealers in caviar in Vienna say the ban on that luxury item may be prompted more by heavy pollution killing caviar-producing fish in the Caspian sea, while Polish dealers in caviar brought back by Polish workers from the Soviet Union doubt the ban will affect their supplies.
The Czechoslovak ban seems to have been the main reason for the Soviet move.
``I hope we are taking retaliatory measures,'' said a senior Soviet economist visiting Vienna in December.
``We can't let the Czechoslovaks just behave like that, however much they want to protect their market.''
In Vienna and eastern Austria, Hungarians' year-old new freedom to travel West as often as they like has spawned dozens of new stores touting the video recorders and sophisticated electronic goods Hungarians love.
On Nov. 7, when they were supposed to be celebrating the 71st anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, 100,000 people from Hungary brought traffic to a complete standstill in Vienna.
Hungarians spent the equivalent of $500 million in Austria last year, while Austrians - who have long enjoyed the cheap dental services, salami and other goods available in Hungary - dumped the equivalent of $300 million in Hungary.
Other Westerners enjoying East bloc plenty are Greeks who travel to neighboring Bulgaria.
Apparently anxious to protect its own consumer market from Greeks, Israeli and Arab tourists who buy cheap dairy products, bedding, blankets and shoes, Bulgaria in December clamped an export ban on those items and dozens of others.
Many of the items that fall under the new East bloc restrictions may not seem desirable to the Western consumer.
Bulgarian vacuum cleaners, Soviet refrigerators and tea from Czechoslovakia may seem unlikely prizes, but they often compensate for shortages at home, or can be sold to residents of East bloc nations willing to pay double or more for such a consumer prize.
Last summer, Austrian border crossings into Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia were crowded with East European cars - mostly East German Trabants driven by enterprising Poles - weighed down to the ground with goods to be sold or consumed at home.
Even before Czechoslovakia formally restricted such traffic, it drew the ire of the nation's border guards.
A line of 50 cars, mostly Poles returning from vacations in Yugoslavia, waited six hours - until 3 a.m. - to cross into Bratislava from Austria last August.
When asked why, a Czechoslovak customs official, muttered, ``The bloody Poles!''
The new freedom to travel also has strained the East bloc's transport capacaties.
Soviets who went on unbridled shopping sprees in Prague's relatively well-stocked and brightly decorated stores found last summer that it would take at leat a bottle of Russian vodka to bribe their way home on hopelessly overbooked trains.
The daily sleeper between Vienna and Moscow also is overbooked, with many Soviet travelers returning from the West reserving bunks simply to take their overweight imports of videocassettes, televisions and other Western goodies.
The only nation that so far seems unaffected by the East European travel boom is Romania, whose 23 million citizens have scarce opportunity to journey abroad.
Those who do get out find their extreme shortages at home - even bread was unavailable in Bucharest for a week in July - make them grateful for the smallest luxury outside.
``Mmm, what a beer!''
beamed a contented Romanian visiting Vienna.
``I'd forgotten the taste.''
The head of the Food and Drug Administration says the number of applications for new drug approvals is doubling every year, a pace that threatens to choke the agency's ability to pass judgment on them.
``We cannot do this with smoke and mirrors,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young on Wednesday told a panel of researchers looking for ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer and AIDS.
Young said the FDA is receiving an average of 10 applications each month requesting permission to begin clinical trials for a new drug, the first step in getting the drug approved for prescription use by the public.
The monthly total has doubled every year since 1984, he said.
Unless the agency gets more staff, ``the whole ship is going to sink,'' Young said after his presentation.
Young defended his agency's record against criticism from government cancer researchers that the FDA is slow in approving new drugs that offer hope of prolonging the lives of cancer and AIDS sufferers.
``Drugs for the desperately ill remain our highest priority,'' Young said.
``Certainly, there will be honest disagreements and inadvertent delays,'' he said.
``But the point I want to make is that we place the highest priority on the review of drugs for life-threatening illness.''
The FDA's review time for 12 important cancer drugs approved in recent years averaged just over 10 months, he said.
The only drug so far approved for AIDS patients, AZT, was approved in 107 days, he said.
New streamlined procedures announced last fall will cut FDA review time in half, he added.
But National Cancer Institute officials said the FDA should be more flexible in its requirements and encourage early testing of new drugs in children who have cancer and AIDS.
They also said the FDA is too stringent in the proof it requires that a proposed new medication extend survival longer than existing drugs.
``You have to stay away from'' insisting on such evidence because the result is that ``it rations a therapy,'' said Dr. Samuel Broder, new director of the National Cancer Institute.
Young said the criticism reflects a ``misperception about FDA requirements.''
He said effects other than survival are considered in approval reviews.
Dr. Louis Lasagna, chairman of the panel studying how to speed up the process, said his committee hopes to establish ``mechanisms to mediate'' the fireworks between the FDA and the cancer institute.
``Because there is so much public pressure regarding AIDS, about not wasting time getting treatments to victims ... we might be able to capitalize on that concern to bring about improvements in the drug approval process,'' Lasagna said.
The panel of nine scientists from leading pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies and major universities and laboratories was appointed by the President's Cancer Panel, headed by Dr. Armand Hammer.
President-elect Bush, as chief of the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief, last year asked the cancer panel to undertake the study.
Hammer said that in a meeting Tuesday, Bush repeated his commitment to the project.
``He was so positive,'' Hammer said.
``I've known him for a great number of years and I've never known him to be so keen about something as he is about that.''
The Congressional Budget Office says slashing next year's federal deficit is going to be a more formidable job than Reagan administration officials and aides to President-elect Bush realize.
The budget office, in a report released Wednesday, said the fiscal 1990 deficit will be $141 billion unless new taxes or spending cuts are instituted.
The Reagan administration has estimated next year's red ink at a more manageable $127 billion.
The numbers presented by the non-partisan congressional agency, if accurate, would make it even more difficult for Bush and Congress to meet the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's 1990 deficit target of $100 billion.
Under that law, if the government fails to come within $10 billion of the deficit target, spending cuts are automatically triggered in a range of domestic and defense programs until the goal is achieved.
Most lawmakers say the resulting reductions in federal services would be so unpopular with the public that this path is politically unfeasible.
The Gramm-Rudman law states that the administration's deficit forecast - not the one made by CB0 - determines whether the automatic cuts would be necessary.
But Congress relies on the CBO figures as a guideline in its budget work.
``Both the Congress and the president, if those projections were way off, will face the same consequences,'' new House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said of the administration's more optimistic forecast.
If CBO is correct, Bush and lawmakers will have to find $41 billion in deficit reductions to meet the Gramm-Rudman target.
Even if the administration's forecast is accurate, many legislators have said that Bush's repeated campaign promises to forego new taxes will make it hard to avoid Gramm-Rudman's automatic cuts.
On Monday, 11 days before he leaves office, President Reagan will present Congress with a $1.2 trillion budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Administration officials have said Reagan found enough savings to produce a $92.5 billion deficit, well within the Gramm-Rudman goal.
Reagan has said if his cuts are made, the budget will be balanced by 1993, the same year the Gramm-Rudman law requires the elimination of the deficit.
The CBO report said, however, that without savings, 1993 will see $129 billion in red ink.
Reagan's spending plan is not binding, and Bush and lawmakers will virtually have to start all over again in their efforts to forge a 1990 spending blueprint.
Last year's deficit was $155 billion, and CBO thinks it will again be that large for fiscal 1989.
The CBO raised its deficit projections from a forecast last August by $7 billion for the current fiscal year and $5 billion for fiscal 1990.
The key reason: the cost of shoring up the ailing savings and loan industry.
The CBO deficit report was based on projections that the economy would continue a slow but steady growth of 2.2 percent in 1990 and 1991 and 2.3 percent in each of the next two years, with unemployment holding steady, inflation increasing slightly next year and interest rates gradually declining.
The family of a Belfast man held hostage in Beirut marked his 1,000th day in captivity with a vigil outside city hall.
Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual British and Irish nationality, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 on his way to the American University in Beirut, where he had just begun to work.
``If we forget, the world forgets,'' said his sister, Brenda Gillham, who stood outside the city hall with three other family members during Wednesday's vigil.
``We must keep the fight going.''
She said the vigil was both for the family members and to ``ask governments: How many more days can a normal human being take?
Maybe the governments will start to think about it.''
Keenan, 38, was using an Irish passport when he was abducted, but both the Irish and British governments are working toward his release.
The British government also seeks the release of Anglican envoy Terry Waite and journalist John McCarthy.
And it seeks word on Alec Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him.
His body was never found.
In all, 15 foreigners are missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage.
They include nine Americans, among them Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted on March 16, 1985.
A former janitor serving a 35-year prison term for a murder that authorities now believe was committed by the so-called ``Southside Strangler'' was granted executive clemency Wednesday.
David Vasquez' pardon was based in part on the recommendation of Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney Helen Fahey, said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
Vasquez, 42, pleaded guilty in 1985 to second-degree murder in the death of Washington lawyer Carolyn Jean Hamm of Arlington.
Vasquez at first confessed to the killing, but recanted his confession and said he entered the guilty plea to avoid a possible capital murder conviction and death sentence.
Vasquez has been imprisoned at Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn.
New evidence, a review of existing evidence, further investigation and analysis by the Arlington County Police Department and the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime convinced authorities that the crime was committed by Timothy Spencer, who has been convicted of capital murder in the deaths of Susan Tucker of Arlington and Debbie Davis of Richmond.
Spencer's convictions were based on DNA tests, also known as ``genetic fingerprinting.''
In such tests, the molecular structure of body fluids and tissues from a crime scene are matched with those of the suspect.
Like fingerprints, each structure is unique to the individual.
After the murder of Ms. Tucker, Arlington police reconsidered whether Vasquez murdered Ms. Hamm.
``Every lead and available scientific process was pursued, and led to the conclusion that Spencer ... was responsible for the Hamm murder,'' a news release issued by the governor's office said.
Ms. Fahey's request for a pardon was reviewed by the Virginia Parole Board, the Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office, the governor's executive staff and Baliles, the news release said.
Vasquez received an ``absolute pardon,'' which restores his constitutional rights and leaves him without a criminal record.
Ms. Fahey had predicted that Vasquez would receive a ``conditional pardon,'' which is similar to being paroled from prison.
A top bank official says the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's dual role as regulator of the savings industry and promoter of home ownership has contributed to the wave of S&L failures.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in commercial banks, said Wednesday the insurance fund for S&Ls should be independent of the bank board.
The primary goal of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits up to $100,000, is the safety and soundness of savings institutions, he said.
However, the FSLIC's parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is also charged with creating, or chartering, S&Ls to provide a steady flow of mortgage money to home buyers.
``There's a basic conflict between those two roles and I think it's very important that they be separated so that the insurer ... can protect his insurance fund and not allow institutions that operate in an unsafe and unsound manner to have insurance,'' Seidman told reporters at a luncheon to release a 408-page FDIC report, ``Deposit Insurance for the Nineties: Meeting the Challenge.''
He recommended a regulatory structure for S&Ls similar to the system for banks.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, charters national banks, while the FDIC insures their deposits.
The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest trade group, has not taken a position on separating the FSLIC from the bank board, but its chairman, B.R. Beeksma, said recently the question should be considered.
The bank board's performance as a chartering agency may be suffering because it is consumed with the problems of the FSLIC, he said.
The FDIC, which prepared the report for Congress, also recommended placing S&L examiners under the FSLIC.
Currently, the examiners work for the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which lend money to S&Ls, are owned by the industry and are controlled by boards composed of S&L executives.
The current system can have the effect of allowing S&Ls with representatives on the regional bank boards to regulate their competitors, Seidman said.
The FDIC made no recommendation on how money should be raised to pay for the S&L crisis, but said it was clear that the federal government, rather than the S&L industry or banks, will have to pay most of the $60 billion to $115 billion needed to restore S&Ls to health.
But, it said, ``concerns about the federal budget deficit could be mitigated by an off-budget financing arrangement'' in which the Treasury pays the interest on borrowing to finance the industry's rescue.
The Treasury Department is preparing a recommendation for President-elect Bush and the new Congress.
Meanwhile, the FDIC rejected proposals to curtail or eliminate federal deposit insurance, arguing that would increase the danger of bank runs.
Some scholars say reducing or doing away with the insurance would force depositors to pay more attention to how well their institutions are run.
The American Bankers Association said in a statement Wednesday that the current practice of protecting even depositors with funds in excess of the $100,000 insurance limit ``has become a license for abuse by some financial managers.''
But, Seidman said, ``In today's complex world, we think the depositor, both sophisticated and unsophisticated, would have great difficulty in knowing the condition of their banks on a day-to-day basis. ... We as bank regulators with thousands of supervisors have difficulty in keeping control of banks in terms of their exact financial condition.''
NBC racked up its 15th consecutive victory, its longest streak in the Nielsens, but CBS was celebrating by winning the top four spots in the rankings and the highest-rated TV movie this season.
``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' about the life and death of the popular singer, followed a big football game Sunday night and ran against ``A View to a Kill'' on ABC and ``Gremlins'' on NBC.
It was the No. 1 show last week with a rating of 26.3 and a 41 share, the A.C. Nielsen Co. said.
That topped the CBS movie of two weeks ago, ``A Very Brady Christmas,'' which had been the highest-rated movie this season with a 25.1 and 39.
Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with television.
The share is a percentage of sets in use during the show's time period.
Sunday's NFL playoff game between Minnesota and San Francisco boosted CBS' Sunday night lineup.
The top 10 shows were: ``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``NFL Playoff Post-Game Show,'' all CBS; ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
and NBC's ``A Different World'' and ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
For the week, NBC had a 13.6 rating, and CBS edged ABC for second, 12.3 to 12.2.
CBS' ``Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story,'' another fact-based movie about a football coach who battled Lou Gehrig's Disease, also scored well and ranked 18th, giving CBS its first Monday night victory this season.
The ``CBS Evening News'' rounded out a good-news week for the network by maintaining its narrow lead in the news race.
CBS had a 12.1 rating and a 22 share.
``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.4 and 21.
``NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.2 and 21.
The Agriculture Department says Americans seem to be eating a bit more each year but are choosier about what's on the menu.
A 20-year statistical study by the department's Economic Research Service found that per capita food consumption overall rose 0.7 percent in 1987 to a record level, including a 1.8 percent increase in foods from crops, while food from animals dropped 0.3 percent.
Analysts said the decline in animal products occurred as a result of lower per capita consumption of beef, eggs, whole milk, butter, lard and edible tallow.
The agency cautioned in the report about taking the figures too literally because much of the information is derived from farm-to-market statistics and other trade information.
``Strictly speaking, the food disappearance estimates should be designated as supplies moving through trade channels for domestic consumption,'' the report said.
``However, because most foods are perishable, changes in disappearance presumably are associated with changes in actual consumption.''
The information is useful as an indicator of trends, even if ``it is not a measure of actual consumption or the quantity ingested'' by consumers, the report added.
For example, the latest review by USDA economists said that crop food consumption rose 17 percent from 1967 to 1987, compared with a 3.5 percent increase in the consumption of animal products.
``Consumption of foods in most crop categories has risen steadily in the last 20 years, especially fats and oils, vegetable, grain products and sweeteners,'' the report said.
``Use of fruit jumped in the mid-1980s.
In contrast, Americans used less red meat, eggs, fluid milk and cream, and animal fats, moderating the increase for animal products.''
Of all the meat consumed by Americans in 1987, 59 percent was red meat - mainly beef and pork - compared with 71 percent in the early 1970s.
Instead, people ate more poultry and fish.
In 1987, for the first time, the per capita consumption of poultry, on a retail weight basis, was greater than beef - 78 pounds per person, compared with 73 pounds, the report said.
But there's a catch.
Measured on the basis of boneless weight, Americans still ate more beef - 69 pounds versus 55 pounds.
``That is because poultry at the retail level contains relatively more bone than beef does,'' the report said.
Per capita consumption of fishery products in 1987 was a record 15.4 pounds, up 45 percent from 1967 and 21 percent more than in 1977.
Egg consumption in 1987 dropped 23 per cent to a per capita average of 249 eggs from 322 in 1967.
The all-time record was 403 eggs in 1945.
In the period of 1985-87, the United States led the world by consuming an average 248 pounds of red meat and poultry per person.
That is a ``carcass weight'' equivalent before a slaughtered animal is divided into smaller cuts.
Australia was second at 230 pounds carcass weight per capita, followed by Argentina and New Zealand, each at 226 pounds.
The Soviet Union, by comparison, averaged 145 pounds per capita.
Japan and Iceland lead the world in the consumption of fishery products.
In the period of 1982-84, the typical Japanese consumed annually an average of 190 pounds of fish and shellfish, liveweight equivalent, more than five times, the consumption of the average American.
With speculation that the first indictments could come soon in the Pentagon fraud case, new court papers provide fresh details on how one private consultant in the case allegedly trafficked in valuable Department information.
A federal grand jury is meeting today and Friday outside Washington, where U.S. attorney Henry Hudson is spearheading the nationwide investigation that began in September 1986.
Sharon Dibbley, Hudson's spokeswoman, refused to say whether any indictments would be handed up this week, but one defense attorney guessed they could come on Friday.
Last November, Hudson predicted indictments could be in hand that month.
Dibbley also kept mum about if and when any plea bargaining arrangements might be revealed.
Hazeltine Corp., of Long Island, N.Y., has said it is cooperating with the government, according to company attorney, William Cummings.
Meantime, a search warrant unsealed this week in federal court painted a vivid picture of the activities of William Parkin, a consultant who made money obtaining information for large defense contractors.
Among the contractors who paid Parkin thousands of dollars were Hazeltine, Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.; Northrop Corp., and Unisys.
Central to the government's case are allegations that consultants bribed Defense Department employees to secure insider information about lucrative, multimillion-dollar government contracts.
Parkin, who was employed by the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project Office from 1977 until 1983, used a variety of means to obtain information, the search warrant says.
Information was obtained through telephone intercepts and recorded conversations.
Parkin's attorney, Gerard Treanor, has said that his client is confident that he had done nothing wrong.
``Parkin is going to be found not guilty before a jury,'' he said.
Here, for example, are some of Parkin's methods for obtaining information, according to the search warrant.
- Last February, Parkin, who was paid by Northrop, sought information about figures on how much the Navy planned to spend on the medium-range remotely piloted vehicle.
Northrop was interested in the contract.
A Navy official would not tell Parkin, but ``did leave Parkin alone in (the) ... office so that Parkin could sneak a look at the papers on the desk.''
Parkin obtained the numbers.
- Parkin paid Jean Uebele, a former contract negotiator at the cruise missile office where Parkin once worked, $100 a week for information, the warrant says.
``Uebele frequently called for her biweekly checks of $50,'' the paper said.
Sheila Wohlfarth, then Parkin's secretary, once told Uebele she was making the checks out to ``Smith's Maid Service.''
Occasionally, Parkin asked Uebele for copies of documents.
``In one conversation in March 1987, Uebele called Parkin and told him that if he parked his car in her place at the Pentagon, she would put materials in the trunk, including all of her instructions, cost and pricing lists, reference books, copies of every contract and information relating to MCDEC,'' the Marine Corps Development Education Center, the search warrant said.
Uebele retired from her job at the Navy last week, her office said.
Her office did not have a forwarding telephone number and her home number was not listed.
- Mrs. Wohlfarth, Parkin's secretary, was the wife of Robert Wohlfarth, a patent attorney with the Navy.
``In an April 1987 conversation Wohlfarth complained to his wife that Parkin promptly paid the other guys he worked with or they called him.
The implication was that Parkin owed Wohlfarth for the information he had provided,'' the search warrant said.
Wohlfarth refused to discuss his relationship, referring all telephone calls to his attorney, Neil Eggleston, who was out of town.
Prosecutors said last week they no longer need to keep under seal search warrants and affidavits issued in June because they've completed the investigative phase of the case.
Papers have been released here and in Brooklyn, N.Y., but remain under seal in St. Louis, Minneapolis and Los Angeles.
Afghan resistance leaders talk as though they are on the threshold of victory: Soviet troops are ready to leave Afghanistan, and the Kremlin's client regime in Kabul is tottering.
But the Afghan guerrillas are as paralyzed politically as they were a decade ago when they started fighting their country's Soviet-backed totalitarian government.
Unable to put aside internal rivalries, the guerrillas have yet to come up with a coherent plan for the future as the Soviet Union tries to negotiate with them in a last-minute show of seeking a political solution to a messy war.
It is a David-and-Goliath image: The communist superpower, unable to vanquish ragged bands of mountain men with its missiles and warplanes, dispatches one of its sharpest negotiators - Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister and ambassador to Kabul - to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan to meet the insurgents.
The fractious alliance of seven Pakistan-based guerrilla groups does not even agree on whether its leaders should be meeting Vorontsov, let alone how to govern Afghanistan - if it should get the chance.
Time is running out.
The Soviet withdrawal, according to a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in Geneva last April, is supposed to be completed by Feb. 15.
The new chairman of the seven-party alliance, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, leader of the Afghan National Liberation Front, seems to epitomize this uncertainty.
Soft-spoken and genteel, the bespectacled, gray-bearded former Islamic theology professor readily acknowledges he cannot speak for all six other leaders in the alliance.
``Mostly, we try our best,'' he said in an interview a few hours before heading to Islamabad, where Vorontsov has been meeting Foreign Ministry officials of Pakistan, one of the chief champions of the guerrillas.
The insurgents also have been armed by the United States, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations.
What, then, is the point of talking to Vorontsov, whose country already has accepted the principle of a broad-based Afghan government to supplant the one headed by its old protegy, President Najib?
``If we refuse and reject negotiations with the Russians, we will be blamed by the world,'' Mojaddidi said.
``For 10 years we have been asking for this ... It is a great success, whether we get a result or not.''
Mojaddidi said the insurgents should propose only one or two leaders - a president, a prime minister or both - to take over from Najib, former head of the feared and loathed KHAD, the Afghan secret police force modeled after the Soviet KGB.
Other guerrilla leaders favor selecting an entire Cabinet or calling parliamentary elections - a monumental task in a nation where war, snow and mountains have rendered vast regions all but inaccessible.
Adding to the logistical problem is the fact that one-third of the 15 million Afghans have fled as refugees to other countries.
About 3 million are in Pakistan.
Another 2 million are in Iran, where eight more guerrilla groups operate independently from the those in Pakistan.
Relatively moderate leaders favor calling ex-King Zahir Shah home from exile in Italy to serve as a symbolic head of government.
The most fervent Islamic fundamentalists reject any role for the king in post-Soviet Afghanistan.
``The people are completely fed up with the (guerrilla) leadership,'' said an Afghan analyst who monitors events in Afghanistan and Peshawar, the town 20 miles from the Afghan border where the seven parties maintain seven separate headquarters.
``What is going to happen?
Are they going to fight each other?
It's a serious possibility,'' the analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Asked whether the alliance would break up, he said: ``There is no alliance.
How is it going to break up?
There are seven parties, seven political departments, seven military departments, seven financial departments.
``They decide between themselves to have a spokesman, and then every other leader makes public statements completely against the alliance,'' he said.
Mojaddidi took over as the alliance's chairman and spokesman on Jan. 1, succeeding Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the first talks with Vorontsov a month ago in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
Rabbani, head of the Jamiat-e-Islami, relinquished the chairmanship after three months in keeping with the alliance's tradition of a revolving leadership.
Mojaddidi, Ahmed Gailani, leader of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, leader of Harakat-e-Inqilab-e-Islami, are the comparative moderates in the alliance.
All three have suggested bringing back the king as a sort of living flag to unite the people long enough to choose a government.
The other four groups in the alliance espouse a more fundamentalist form of Islam than that advocated by Mojaddidi, Gailani and Mohammadi.
The most intransigent opponents of monarchy are Gulbaddin Hekmatyar of Hezb-e-Islami and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf of the Ittehad-e-Islami.
The other two leaders, Younus Khalis and Rabbani, also have opposed the return of the king, but they have toned down the vehemence of their earlier rejections.
Khalis' group, like Hekmatyar's, is named Hezb-e-Islami.
A high school canceled classes for a second day Thursday after a custodian was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease and another custodian began showing symptoms of the disease.
Test results to determine if the second custodian at Hunterdon Central Regional High School has the disease should be available in about five days, said Marilyn Riley, state Health Department spokeswoman.
The bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease is transmitted through the air from vaporized water, Ms. Riley said.
Health officials inspected the building Thursday for bacteria sources.
Samples of water will be taken Friday and Sunday from the school, she said.
``Our feeling is, if we're going to have to run a disrupted school day because of the testing, we may as well take one more day off,'' said district spokesman Willard Richard.
``We're also concerned about any possible health hazard.
We don't want to be taking chances.''
A 33-year-old male custodian, who officials have declined to identify, was diagnosed with Legionnaires' in December.
He was responding to treatment at Warren Hospital in Phillipsburg and was expected to be released soon, Ms. Riley said.
He was admitted to the hospital Dec. 18.
A 44-year-old custodian at the school became sick Jan. 2 with pneumonia and a high fever.
He also was responding to therapy and doing well in Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, she said.
Legionnaires' disease is fatal about in 15 percent to 20 percent of confirmed cases, said Robert Breiman, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
It is usually successfully treated with antibiotics.
The source of Legionnaires' disease would be easier to find if the second custodian has the disease, but it would not confirm that the bacteria was at the school because the men could have been in a common place other than the school when they contracted the bacteria, Breiman said.
If only the one case is confirmed, it will be harder to determine its source, he said.
About 1,850 students from Flemington, Readington, Delaware, Raritan and East Amwell townships attend the school.
People under 20 years old usually are not affected by the bacteria, called legionella pneumophila, Breiman said.
It most commonly strikes elderly people and those whose immune systems are weakened, he said.
Legionnaires' disease was named from an outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in July 1976.
Thirty-four people - 29 Legionnaires or family members and five other people who had been near the hotel - eventually died of the disease.
About 800 to 1,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported to the center each year, Breiman said.
There is no vaccine, he said.
Oliver L. North will face 12 other charges once the judge in the Iran-Contra case grants a prosecution motion to dismiss the two major charges against the former National Security Council aide.
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is asking U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to dismiss charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of government property stemming from the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras.
According to legal experts, Gesell has little discretion in the matter, meaning in all likelihood the charges will be dismissed.
Walsh wants the charges dismissed ``without prejudice,'' meaning he would be free to bring the counts again if the national security problems would be worked out.
But Gesell scheduled a hearing for Monday to hear defense arguments.
The defense is expected to argue the charges should be dismissed forever.
The remaining charges and the penalties against North are as follows:
Obstruction of Congress in Sept. and Oct. 1985, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
False statements to Congress on Sept. 5, 1985, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
False statements to Congress by North on Sept. 12, 1985, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
False statements by North to Congress on Oct. 7, 1985, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
Obstruction of Congress in Aug. 1986, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
Obstruction of Congress in Nov. 1986, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
Obstruction of a presidential inquiry in Nov. 1986, five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
False statements on Nov. 23, 1986, five-year imprisonment, $250,000 fine.
Destroying or falsifying government documents, three-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
Receipt of an illegal gratuity, the installation of a security fence around his suburban Virginia home, two-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
Conversion of traveler's checks to personal use, 10-year imprisonment, $250,000 fine.
Conspiracy to defraud the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, five-year imprisonment, $250,000 fine.
A wire fraud charge stemming from the diversion and a charge that North created false documents to obstruct the investigation of the security fence were dismissed last year on other legal grounds.
At one time, U.S. diplomats got into hot water if they clinked teacups with members of the PLO, but now the State Department has switched signals.
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed Thursday that American officials around the world have been given the green light to mix with Palestine Liberation Organization representatives - but strictly on an informal basis.
``There have been instructions that have allowed people in social settings to respond socially to introductions,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
The spokeswoman emphasized the new policy for formal contacts between the United States and the Palestinian group still stands: U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau, is the only person authorized to conduct America's diplomatic dialogue with the PLO.
``The one channel for communication with the PLO officially remains our ambassador in Tunis,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
The spokeswoman declined to outline the exact ``diplomatic ... niceties of teacups and handshakes,'' but said ``people may respond socially in a setting.
If you're introduced, there may be the exchange of courtesies.''
``These are not to be construed as official contacts,'' she said, adding it was expected such meetings might occur at diplomatic receptions or ``in a group at a large party, if people meet or are introduced.''
One State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new policy came about after President Reagan's historic decision in mid-December to reverse the policy of refusing to deal with members of the organization, long shunned as a band of terrorists.
Reagan said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had met U.S. demands by renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist.
Two days after Secretary of State George Shultz announced Reagan's decision to drop the 13-year ban on contacts with the PLO, Pelletreau met for an hour and 40 minutes with a PLO delegation in Tunis, where the organization has its headquarters.
``Suddenly, ambassadors wanted to know what to do if they got calls from a PLO representative, saying, `I've been told we can have a dialogue, when can we meet?'''
the official said.
He said a message was sent to all U.S. embassies as a ``guideline for people about what they can and cannot do. ... It's just normal courtesy.''
``It means no one will go out of their way to set up a meeting, but if you're in a social setting and a PLO official walks up to you, of course you're not going to walk away,'' he said.
``Now you can have a social conversation.''
The official stressed that the change was a subtle one.
``We haven't recognized the PLO, we haven't recognized a Palestinian state,'' he said.
Even so, any contact is considered sensitive.
In 1979, U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young resigned his post amid controversy over an unauthorized meeting he held with a PLO representative in a Manhattan apartment.
Education lobbyists say they have the perfect way for George Bush to fulfill his pledge to be the education president: raise federal education spending by $10 billion in his first term.
``There's an education deficit analogous to the Grand Canyon.
To have someone throw in a shovel of dirt is not going to solve the problem,'' said Gerald Morris, president of a 100-member coalition called the Committee for Education Funding.
The committee suggested Thursday that Bush start with an immediate down payment of $2.5 billion in the Education Department budget for fiscal 1990.
That would be an 11 percent increase over the current $21.9 billion budget.
Furthermore, the committee said, Bush should add $500 million to Head Start, the preschool program for disadvantaged children that is run by the Department of Health and Human Services.
``We don't see that it's unrealistic or unattainable,'' Becky Timmons, vice president of the committee, said of the spending blueprint.
During his presidential campaign, Bush made several expensive education proposals, including $500 million for a ``Merit Schools'' program to help the disadvantaged, $400 million for Head Start and $50 million for magnet schools.
However, Bush has also vowed to cut the deficit and not raise taxes.
He is expected to rework the lame-duck budget Reagan will be sending to Congress on Monday.
That document reportedly will recommend $35 billion in cuts across the government.
Morris said his coalition is not taking positions on the tax issue or on which types of domestic spending could be cut to offset education increases.
But he and others said they are encouraged by Bush's campaign promises, his ``tone of moderation'' and his appointments so far.
``We haven't had the luxury of working with the administration in the last seven years because we've been on opposite sides of the fence,'' Morris said in reference to the Reagan administration, which repeatedly sought cuts in the education budget.
He said a Bush administration is likely to be more hospitable.
``We may have a very different and warmer - and certainly welcome - environment,'' he said.
The funding committee is a non-profit, non-partisan coalition of groups that represent more than 50 million students, parents, teachers, administrators, presidents, librarians, counselors, trustees and school board members.
Virtually every major education group in the country is a member.
Under its plan, $1.6 billion of the 1990 increase would go to programs for disadvantaged students of all ages, from remedial tutoring to college tuition grants.
Another $768 million would cover the cost of inflation for all federal education programs, while $150 million would be reserved for presidential initiatives and modest increases in small existing programs.
According to the committee, education spending accounted for 2.5 percent of the federal budget in fiscal 1979 but only 1.7 percent in fiscal 1988.
Officials cited the following statistics to make the case for a four-year, $10 billion investment:
--From 1979 to 1988, Pell grants to needy college students went from covering 50 percent of all college expenses to 29 percent while the buying power of the maximum award declined 13 percent.
--Head Start serves less than 20 percent of the children who qualify for it.
--Chapter 1, the major federal program for disadvantaged elementary and secondary school children, serves less than half those eligible.
--Federal money for educating handicapped children now covers only 8 percent of per-pupil expenditures as opposed to 12.5 percent in 1979.
A Senate committee chairman wants the FBI to look into a newspaper's allegations that one of President-elect Bush's Cabinet nominees headed a GOP organization ``riddled with former Nazi collaborators.''
The Oakland (Calif.) Tribune, in an editorial Dec. 28, said its questions should be answered before the Senate approves Bush's nomination of Edward Derwinski as the first head of the newly created Department of Veterans Affairs.
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who will conduct the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee's confirmation hearings on the nomination, asked Bush to look into the editorial's charges in the course of ``its customary background investigation.''
The editorial said Derwinski associated with former fascists and anti-Semites in 1972 when he headed the executive board of the Heritage Groups for Re-election of the President and this year when he co-chaired Bush's Coalition of American Nationalities.
Through a spokesman, Derwinski said the charges amounted to ``guilt by association.''
Several members of the coalition resigned this summer after the Washington Jewish Week said they had pro-fascist or anti-Semitic records during World War II.
Derwinski, who served for 23 years as a Republican congressman from Cook County, Ill., is in the State Department as undersecertary for security assistance, science and technology.
He was not available for comment Thursday, but a spokesman, Bill Anderson, said of the editorial: ``It is guilt by association.
He has had nothing to do with the hiring or the service of those mentioned in this article.
Anyone who examines his record in support, for example, of Jewish organizations, or as a diplomat in Israel can categorically rule out any anti-Semitism on his part.''
Anderson said Derwinski had lent his name to Republican ethnic committees in every presidential election campaign since 1960.
Cranston, in his letter to Bush, said he raised the issue with Derwinski Wednesday during ``a nice meeting with him to discuss the forthcoming nomination.''
He sent Bush a copy of the editorial and wrote, ``As you can see the editorial raises serious charges.''
``Before the U.S. Senate approves him it ought to ask the nominee whether he intends to represent American veterans or Nazi veterans, American democratic ideals or those of foreign dictatorships,'' the editorial said.
``Those questions are apt, given Derwinski's record of service in an organization riddled with former Nazi collaborators and his alleged role in passing U.S. secrets to the South Korean CIA in the late 1970s,'' it said, but added:
``The record certainly doesn't prove that Derwinski is a closet Nazi sympathizer or a foe of democracy.
But it does call into profound question his judgment, in particular his willingness to turn a blind eye to the background and beliefs of notorious colleagues if they share his anti-communism.''
The paper quoted Russ Bellant, author of a study published by Political Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., as saying that ``at least four people charged with war crimes were in leadership positions'' of the 1972 Republican group Derwinski headed.
The research group calls itself an independent organization that gathers information on ``right-wing groups and trends.''
The editorial also said that during a 1977 House investigation of alleged South Korean influence peddling on Capitol Hill, Derwinski appeared to be responsible for leaking to the Korean government the defection of an official of the Korean Central Inelligence Agency.
But Anderson said the House Ethics Committee investigated and cleared Derwinski of tipping off the South Korean government.
The nation's cities expect a more ``mature relationship'' with the federal government under George Bush than they have had during the Reagan era, the incoming president of the National League of Cities says.
Using a parent-child analogy to discuss how cities have fared in their dealings with the federal government, Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard told a National Press Club luncheon on Thursday:
``During the sixties and seventies we had a pampered childhood. ... And then very abruptly at the beginning of the eighties, we were orphaned. ... We were thrown out in the storm and we were told to fend for ourselves.''
``We're looking for a new relationship, a mature relationship, one that binds two powerful entities, the federal government and local government into a common purpose,'' and partnership said Goddard, who was recently elected the league's president.
The league is the nation's largest and oldest organization representing towns and cities.
Although he said the cities had learned to cope, stretch resources and survive their ``Oliver Twist'' adolescent period without Washington, the 41-year-old Goddard said municipalities face problems like the spread of drugs, lack of affordable housing, and decaying infrastructure and environment.
``There is serious trouble in urban America,'' he said.
Goddard said the problems of cities are often ignored because they're dull and gradual.
He said they aren't noticed until ``after a system fails, after a building collapses or a bridge falls through.''
But he said the new administration should focus on what can be done to prevent catastrophe before it happens.
Goddard met Thursday afternoon with Jack Kemp, Bush's nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he presented the league's proposal for six initiatives for the Bush administration and the 101st Congress to help tackle urban problems.
The proposal includes establishing a council of urban advisers, developing a comprehensive national housing policy, a national policy on children and families and a new federal surface transportation policy, and invigorating federal support for urban research.
Goddard said cities recognize the federal deficit problem and don't seek a return to their pampered days, ``but we do need a positive administration response, one which is willing to use national leadership and coordination to help us save money and add a sense of direction.''
Goddard said Bush could demonstrate a commitment to a partnership with cities if he consults local officials, sets up a mechanism to consider the impact of agencies' actions and regulations on municipalities, evaluates approaches cities have found successful in dealing with their problems and doesn't rule out spending new funds in critical areas.
That done, ``We pledge to help the president-elect become the best urban president this country has known,'' said Goddard.
As four Mariel Cuban detainees convicted of crimes after fleeing their homeland in 1980 were returned to Cuba, a government spokesman said he hoped such repatriations will speed up.
But Auxiliary Bishop Agustin A. Roman of Miami called again for a halt to the repatriations, saying the Cubans had been denied due process and that their human rights could not be assured in Cuba.
The four, who had been detained at the federal prison at Talladega, Ala., left Birmingham shortly after 2 p.m. Thursday for the 90-minute flight to an airport near Havana.
Earlier in the day, U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in Birmingham denied the request to stay the repatriation of Jose Nodarse-Valdes and Juan Cajigal-Mulen.
Nodarse-Valdes, 39, was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and assault, and Cajigal-Mulen, 31, was convicted of robbery and cocaine possession, the Justice Department said.
The other two repatriated Thursday were Ricardo Olivera-Quintero, 28, convicted of murder, and Mario Sosa-Hernandez, 50, convicted of illegal possession of heroin with intent to sell, said Justice Department spokesman Joseph C. Krovisky.
The detainees were among 125,000 people who had fled Cuba in the so-called Mariel flotilla in 1980.
They were the third batch of prisoners returned to Cuba since early December 1988, when repatriation of some detainees was resumed under a 1984 agreement with that island nation.
Five detainees were returned Dec. 2, followed by four more Dec. 15.
About 400 Cubans are on a Justice Department list of people who might face repatriation, and another 400 to 500 are on that list but will not be repatriated until they finish serving prison and jail terms, said Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Duke Austin.
Asked whether detainees would continue to be repatriated every few weeks in groups of four or five, Austin said, ``We certainly hope that the numbers will improve, but it's all subject to what the courts do.''
But Roman, in telephone interview from Miami, criticized the latest deportations and reiterated his call that they be stopped.
``We are asking to defer the deportation until ... we will be assured human rights will be observed,'' Roman said.
Austin contended that special care already has been taken to protect their legal rights.
``I don't know of any alien in the United States that has ever had more legal review of their case than the Cubans have,'' Austin said.
``These people have had formal hearings in front of immigration judges,'' he said.
``They've had appeals in front of the board of immigration appeals, made up of independent law judges.
They've had legal action in the district court in Georgia, before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Supreme Court of the United States has reviewed their cases twice.
If that isn't due process, I don't know what is.''
The repatriation program for 2,746 Cubans was suspended in 1985 at Cuban President Fidel Castro's insistence after 201 were returned.
In 1987, the United States and Castro agreed to resume the repatriations.
The 1987 agreement set off 11 days of rioting in November 1987 at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La.
After the riots, the Justice Department began a review process to determine which Cubans should be repatriated.
That review resulted in the list of the 800 to 900 people to be returned to Cuba.
A chlorine cloud as big as six football fields spewed from a factory Thursday near the site of the Reagan presidential library, forcing thousands of evacuations, backing traffic up for miles on closed roads and freeways and injuring three firefighters.
Chlorine escaped during most of the day from a 5,000-gallon, 30-ton tank at the Traveling West Textile Co., forming a greenish-yellow, potentially deadly cloud on the outskirts of this suburb northwest of Los Angeles.
Just after dark, a specially outfitted hazardous-materials squad was able to tighten a valve on the tank.
``They got a big wrench and tightened the valve,'' said Battalion Chief Larry Whelan.
Earlier, firefighters directed a high-pressure, 80-foot stream of water on the tank, a process that caked the loose valve with ice, temporarily sealing the leak.
While the leak was stalled, the cloud over Simi Valley dissipated and the valve on the tank was tightened.
As a precaution, the valve was then capped, Whelan said.
At 7 p.m., the evacuation order was lifted, giving way to massive traffic jams in this city of 100,000 people.
Whelan said an estimated 11,500 people had been evacuated from offices and homes in a 15-square-mile area after the leak was reported at 7:40 a.m. The evacuees included at least 1,400 students, 1,000 business workers and the 125-member staff of the Simi Valley Enterprise newspaper.
Three members of the Fire Department's hazardous materials team were taken to the hospital, Ventura County fire spokeswoman Susan Chandler said.
Two of them were treated and released; the other was kept for observation.
``We don't expect any major injuries or deaths,'' Ms. Chandler said.
The gas from the factory at Madera Road and Easy Street settled in a huge cloud over the northwest part of the city, not far from the 100-acre foothill site where the $60 million Reagan library is to be built.
It spread slowly during the day, and was 100 feet by 600 yards by late afternoon, said Ms. Chandler.
Traveling West, which dyes bulk textiles, had been closing down the factory in preparation to move out of state, fire officials said.
Whelan said the tank was drained on Tuesday of all but 20 to 50 gallons of liquid chlorine used to treat plant wastewater before it was funneled into the sewers.
Chlorine and its compounds are used for bleaching in the paper and textile industries, for disinfecting municipal water supplies, for household bleaches and germicides and in the production of many organic and inorganic chemicals.
The giant plumes blasted into the sky by volcanoes may look like ordinary clouds, but they contain engine-clogging ash that can pose disaster for unsuspecting aircraft.
To avoid dangerous events like those that forced two airliners to land with engine malfunctions in 1982, a pair of federal agencies is launching a new volcano watch program for aviators.
The volcano alert project was announced Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, although a formal start-up date was not set.
Over the years, major volcanic eruptions have spewed vast plumes of ash to high altitudes where it was spread widely by strong winds.
In one case in 1982, ash from Galuggung volcano in Indonesia caused engine shutdowns in Boeing 747 airliners on June 23 and on July 13.
Both planes were forced to land when their engines malfunctioned after being coated with the glass-like ash.
More than 20 volcanic eruptions have been reported beneath the North Pacific air routes between North America and Asia in just the past five years.
Active volcano areas include Italy, Greece, New Zealand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, East Africa, Hawaii and the Caribbean.
Volcanic ash plumes can spread as high as 60,000 feet and, especially at night, it can be difficult for a pilot to tell when a cloud is being entered.
In the new warning program, NOAA weather satellites, pilot reports and other sources of information will be used to watch for volcanic eruptions.
The U.S. Geological Survey and the worldwide Scientific Event Alert Network operated by the Smithsonian Institution will also assist.
While weather satellites are expected to be the primary source of information, scientists stress that in the early stages of an eruption it can be very difficult to tell the difference between ash clouds and ordinary water or ice clouds.
Heat imaging satellites should help in this area.
Once an eruption is detected, the FAA will be kept advised of the location, height and movement of ash clouds.
The Civil Aviation Organization of the United Nations will also be informed of volcanic cloud movement so it can advise airlines from other nations.
The advisories will report height and plume movement at two-hour intervals and will provide short- and long-range forecasts of cloud movement.
Here are brief profiles of the individuals indicted Friday in connection with the federal government's investigation into Pentagon fraud and the three figures who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the probe.
--Stuart E. Berlin, the only government employee indicted in the case, headed the ship systems engineering branch of the Naval Air Systems Command from October 1986 until he was reassigned by the Pentagon in June 1988.
Berlin, a Navy procurement specialist, faces charges of accepting bribes in exchange for providing classified information.
Court documents say Berlin provided information to Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp., of Greenlawn, N.Y.
--William L. Parkin, an Alexandria, Va., defense consultant, worked in the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project from 1977 to 1983.
According to affadavits released last week, Parkin was hired by Hazeltine to get inside information from the Pentagon that would allow the company to compete for a $15.9 million contract for battlefield equipment.
The indictments said Teledyne agreed to pay Parkin's firm $160,000 to obtain inside information in obtaining a Navy contract.
--Fred H. Lackner, a Woodland Hills, Calif., consultant, has worked for a number of aerospace companies, including Northrop Electronics in Hawthorne, Calif., Stromberg Carlson Corp. in Winter Park, Fla., then a unit of General Dynamics and later a division of United Technologies and the Systems Development unit of Unisys.
The indictment said Lackner and Berlin struck an agreement that Berlin would help Teledyne Electronics win a contract in exchange for money.
--Joseph Colarusso, 58, is a former senior vice president of the Hazeltine Corp., a division of Emerson Electronics Co.
Colarusso, who worked at the Greenlawn office, joined Hazeltine in 1959 and was appointed senior vice president in 1984.
He resigned on Dec. 1, 1988.
Colarusso pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud.
--Charles Furciniti, 54, is a former marketing representative of the Hazeltine Corp., who held the title of vice president.
He worked for the company for 20 years, resigning in May 1988 to take a job with another firm.
Like Colarusso, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud.
--Michael Savaides, 41, is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist for Teledyne.
According to the government, Savaides had a financial relationship with Parkin.
Affadavits showed that Parkin, Berlin and Savaides had planned at one time to divide $150,000 from Teledyne.
--Other Teledyne employees named in the indictment are George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer.
Federal funding for AIDS programs would expand by 30 percent while Medicare and Medicaid would be restrained under a health and human services budget the Reagan administration will submit to Congress on Monday, a published report said.
The New York Times in its Saturday editions reported that the $424.4 billion budget for the Department of Health and Human Resources amounts to $22.8 billion more than the department got in 1988.
More than half of the budget, $260 billion, would be spent on Social Security, which would receive $13 billion more than is now spent to cover an increase in recipients and a 3.6 percent cost-of-living boost, the Times said.
The proposed expenditures are subject to revision by President-elect George Bush after Jan. 20 and by Congress, although Bush has said he would not make cuts in Social Security, which goes to more than 40 million Americans.
For AIDS, the Reagan administration recommended spending $2.5 billion, including $1.6 billion for research, education and prevention and $925 million for treatment and other assistance for AIDS victims.
The administration proposed $106.1 billion for Medicare, an increase of $10 billion, but still $3.5 billion less than would have occurred under current law.
It proposed $36 billion for Medicaid, a boost of nearly $2 billion but $2 billion less than under current law, the Times said.
Medicare is the health insurance program for 31 million older Americans and 3 million other disabled persons and Medicaid is a federal-state health program for the poor.
Central American immigrants filed suit against the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday, demanding that the agency once again let them travel to their U.S. destinations to apply for asylum.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Brownsville, seeks to reverse INS rules of Dec. 16 that made it impossible for most asylum-seekers to leave south Texas or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial of their claims.
``It would allow the asylum applicant to have the interview and the adjudication of the asylum claim heard and decided by the INS office nearest their intended residence in the U.S.,'' said Robert Rubin, who heads the national Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project for the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs.
A hearing has been set for 9 a.m. Monday on their motion for a temporary restraining order.
INS officials in Washington declined comment on the lawsuit because they had not seen it.
Most Central Americans enter the United States illegally in the Brownsville area of the lower Rio Grande Valley, the nearest land point to Central America.
Officials with the INS' Harlingen District said nine personnel were added Friday, bringing the total of Harlingen asylum adjudicators to 16, and will speed up processing and eliminate a backlog.
The lawsuit accuses the INS of imposing a policy change without allowing public comment; of denying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel; and improperly restricting the right to work.
It cites the case of a 69-year-old Nicaraguan woman who said she slept outside the INS office in Harlingen for three nights to keep her place in line, then was told she needed a fingerprint card.
She said she then walked four miles to the Harlingen Police Department to obtain the prints, then returned to the INS office where she again slept outside to keep her place.
Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in Harlingen were allowed to travel to their U.S. destinations to apply for asylum, often Miami or Los Angeles.
INS officials said they adopted the new procedure in Harlingen to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb abuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum cases.
They also said the new procedure apparently has begun to deter frivolous claims, with the more than 2,000 claims a week in early December reduced to about 1,000 a week since Dec. 16.
Those who previously would have traveled out of the area are staying in places such as the condemned Amber Motel in Brownsville, on the border 25 miles south of Harlingen, and a squalid, makeshift campsite where several hundred people have carved out spaces in the brush.
The federal government is recommending that airlines replace tens of thousands of rivets on more than 600 older Boeing 727 passenger jets.
In a proposed directive issued Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration also urged the carriers to adopt special inspection procedures until the rivet work is done.
The repairs are not expected to disrupt air service because most of the work will be done on a timetable that could stretch over as long as four years, FAA officials said.
The proposed directive is the result of increasing concern about cracking on older commercial jetliners.
It is similar to an order issued last October for older Boeing 737s.
A final order will not be issued until after a brief period to allow public and industry comment.
The FAA estimated the repairs and extra inspections of 623 older Boeing 727s will cost the airlines $35.7 million.
In a separate action Friday, the FAA broadened a previous directive for special inspections of older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s to include any aircraft with at least 45,000 landings.
Last November, the agency told airlines to conduct repetitive inspections using the electronic ``eddy current'' method of all DC-9s that have had more than 55,000 landings because of concern about possible cracks in the fuselage skin.
But the agency said since then it has discovered cracks on more than 20 aircraft that had between 45,000 and 52,000 landings, prompting the special precautions for the additional aircraft.
The agency said 476 DC-9s belonging to U.S. air carriers would be affected by the new directive.
Under the order, airlines must conduct repetitive eddy current inspections of the fuselage skin as well as an area just over the wings on the DC-9s.
The inspections must be conducted at least every 5,800 landings.
The proposed directive on the Boeing 727s requires that airlines over the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets on each plane, depending on the model of 727 involved.
It said the ``countersunk'' rivets now on the planes is believed to cause cracking under some circumstances, while the substitute ``button-head'' is less likely to do so.
The FAA said cracks on both the 727 and 737 aircraft have been traced to a ``cold bonding'' process that was used in the earlier models of the plane to bind sheets of fuselage skin together.
That method was discontinued in later models.
The agency said it plans to order eddy current testing and increased visual testing of the Boeing 727 on a regular basis until the rivets can be changed.
Last October, the FAA ordered thousands of rivets replaced on older Boeing 737s to help guard against cracking.
There have been a number of incidents during the past year in which large cracks developed on older aircraft.
Inmates at the Youthful Correctional Offender Institution rioted for about two hours Friday, but corrections officers and police tactical units stayed on overnight, authorities said.
Three inmates and one corrections officer were injured in the uprising and there was ``minimal damage'' to the lockup said Kathy Drake, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections in Atlanta.
Ms. Drake said she did not know what set off the disturbance or how many inmates were involved.
Despite the name of the facility, the average age of the 970 inmates at the prison is 24, according to Ms. Drake.
Ms. Drake said the injured officer, who was not identified, broke his hand, apparently by slipping and falling.
The injury, she said, ``was not in contact with an inmate.''
She did not have details of the inmates' injuries.
Five tactical units of 18 officers each were called in to help stop the uprising, which began about 4:45 p.m., apparently in sympathy with a disturbance at a nearby state prison earlier this week.
The riot, which broke out around 4:45 p.m. with inmates damaging and breaking property, Ms. Drake said.
The crowd control officers used tear gas to halt the uprising in the Kemper Building, one of three units comprising the lockup, Ms. Drake said.
``When they did (use tear gas), they immediately began to quiet down.
It then spilled over into the Holly Building (a second unit),'' she said.
Tear gas was not used in the second unit, because the situation there was not as severe, Ms. Drake said.
``There was no damage done.
It was mostly a lot of yelling, a lot of cussing,'' she said.
Because the tear gas spread beyond the Kemper Building, about 100 inmates could not be returned immediately to their cells, and were held in a yard until the gas clears, Ms. Drake said.
Two tactical units from Milledgeville, in central Georgia about 25 miles east of Macon, and one from Reidsville remained on the scene, Ms. Drake said, adding that the Department of Corrections would begin an internal investigation into the disturbance.
If the inmates who were responsible are identified, they would be segregated from the rest of the prison population and would face administrative charges, she said.
Friday's uprising marked the second disturbance at a Georgia prison this week.
On Tuesday, inmates rioted at Rivers Correctional Institution in Milledgeville, an incident officials called the most serious in the state in 10 years.
More than 900 inmates participated in the earlier incident, with three officers and three inmates injured and $300,000 in damage reported.
The legality of executing mentally retarded people is being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court this week by a Texas murderer with the mind of a 7-year-old.
The high court Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments on whether executing Johnny Paul Penry for a 1979 rape-slaying would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution.
A federal appeals court previously rejected Penry's arguments.
The 32-year-old Penry has an IQ estimated at between 50 and 60.
His schooling consists of a few days in the first grade, and he was in and out of mental hospitals while growing up near Houston.
``I was abused -- treated like a dog.
My mother broke my arm about eight times.
My left arm is three inches shorter than my right,'' Penry said in an interview last summer.
Convicted of rape in 1977, he served two years of a five-year prison term.
Three months after his release, he was charged with the murder of Pamela Mosely Carpenter, a Livingston housewife who was raped, beaten and fatally stabbed with scissors she was using to make Halloween decorations.
Penry's case is the second within a year to result in Supreme Court review of the Texas capital punishment law, which since 1974 has sent nearly 300 men and women to death row.
Since 1976, when the high court allowed capital punishment to resume, 29 men have been put to death in Texas -- more than any other state.
Among them was Donald Gene Franklin, whose attorneys last year argued that Texas jurors were not allowed to consider mitigating circumstances such as his good behavior in prison in deciding whether he should be put to death.
Penry's case is viewed in part as a follow-up to Franklin's, whose challenge was rejected in June by a 6-3 vote.
Franklin was executed Nov. 3.
The court will be asked to consider whether jurors should have considered Penry's retardation before deciding to impose a death sentence and whether anyone with Penry's mental capacity ever should get the death penalty, said Penry's attorney, Curtis Mason.
A court ruling that people with Penry's mental capacity should not be executed could have major, nationwide impact, according to Bob Walt, an assistant Texas attorney general who handles capital cases.
``You can always find psychiatrists who come in and say this person is mentally retarded,'' Walt said.
Mason is optimistic about a ruling in his favor and sees Penry getting a new trial or having the death sentence commuted to life.
He dismissed the idea that many killers would contend they are retarded to avoid the death chamber.
``With somebody who is retarded, there generally is a long history,'' Mason said.
``With Penry, his history goes way back.
When he first was diagnosed as retarded, he was 9.''
Walt, however, said the Penry case already has resulted in execution delays for inmates who are not retarded but claim to be.
``I have six or seven where they brought in a psychiatrist and say he's mentally retarded,'' Walt said.
He added that Penry is the only Texas death row inmate considered retarded by state officials.
Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox said that although Penry has low intelligence, he was aware of what he was doing when he raped and killed Mrs. Carpenter.
``His IQ may be below 70,'' Mattox said.
``But the question is whether or not he can adapt his behavior to what he knows is right and wrong, and there's no doubt in this particular case that he knows the difference between right and wrong.
He had enough intelligence to know if he raped a victim that he needed to kill the victim.''
A Supreme Court decision is not expected for three or four months.
Penry, who says he can't remember the year he was born and barely can write his name, haltingly told interviewers of his ``miserable childhood'' and said: ``I do need help -- all that I can get.
I don't think by executing me they can get the job done.''
First lady Nancy Reagan was saluted Monday night for her sense of style and her contribution to the American fashion industry.
Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual awards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.
One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of the most important in our country and I think the American fashion designers are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing a brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.
Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs. Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eight years in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ... that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much.
Style.
Presence.
A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''
Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of the council, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion on the pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to American fashion.''
Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution to fashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense of sophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the United States.''
Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She has shown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and so American.''
Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of her high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House -- a practice critics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whose clothes she wore.
But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be ``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.
Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to the ceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, a spokeswoman for the first lady.
Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremony who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit designed by Mizrahi.
Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy, presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to photographer Richard Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to American fashion and his photographic reportage of historical events.''
Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design.
Nina Hyde, fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her reporting on American fashion.
Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the house of Chanel, received a special award for his international fashion influence.
Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was recognized for her promotion of American fashion in the media.
Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special humanitarian award.
A former Yale University lecturer who was stripped of his American citizenship in 1986 for his role as a Nazi propagandist in the Soviet Union during World War II has asked for refugee status in Canada, a report said Monday.
Vladimir Sokolov disappeared in July when he was scheduled to appear at a deportation hearing in Hartford, Conn.
His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming that his life would be in danger if he was forced to return to the Soviet Union, the Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported.
No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian language newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow.
Anti-Semitic articles appeared under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive tracts were written by Nazi censors.
His Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, said Sokolov faces almost certain death if deported to the Soviet Union.
``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have called him a traitor,'' Grey said.
``He would likely be put to death or given a lengthy sentence.
For all practical purposes it would be the end of his life.''
Grey, a noted constitutional lawyer who is also defending convicted murderer John Joseph Kindler from extradition to the United States where he faces the death penalty, said the 75-year-old Sokolov is in very poor health.
Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he entered the United States as a displaced person.
He became a citizen in 1957 and two years later began lecturing on Russian language and Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he later resigned.
But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before filing a complaint to strip him of his American citizenship.
One of every three men and women walking down the aisle in the United States has been married before, but the remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according to a National Center for Health Statistics report.
The government report also shows that most divorced men marry divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in 1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an average 37 years old.
The report is based on samples of records from states that compile marriage and divorce statistics.
It studies data collected from 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures were available.
The number of remarriages increased during the period studied, rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
But although the number of remarriages was growing over those years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the report said.
In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per 1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970.
The rate for divorced men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the report said.
``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of divorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.
The figures also show that most women marry men of the same marital status.
In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced and 2 percent were both widowed.
Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and this generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages, according to the study.
The only combinations in which that trend is broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men.
In 1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.
Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for second and subsequent marriages, the report noted.
While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed in religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for marriages involving divorced men and women.
Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern -- many more are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said.
But second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly throughout the year.
Fear that the U.S. government will go it alone in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of dollars every year, according to a report published by the International Monetary Fund.
Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III, designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will single out favored countries as trading partners instead of promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose members include the governments of the major industrial countries, says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year between 1984 and 1986.
The biggest costs are in the United States, western Europe and Japan.
The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary of the treasury.
Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do if there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by representatives of 96 countries.
``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club' approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries but tending to freeze out others.
A similar deal with Israel was made earlier last year.
A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European Economic Community.
Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense of those outside the club.
The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of representatives from the 96 governments.
They agreed on how to negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two years of talks.
But they failed to agree on four others, including agriculture.
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that other governments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cutting them in the immediate future.
Bush has picked Yeutter as his secretary of agriculture.
On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal.
But negotiations are being soured by a fight between the European community and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S. farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.
Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over $100 million a year.
The Reagan administration retaliated with increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danish hams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make them too expensive for Americans to want to buy.
The Europeans are threatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a list ready should that happen.
A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers of foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the rails.
Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by Carla Hills.
The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called ``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.''
It was written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads the fund's Trade and Payments Division.
The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United States holding the biggest block of votes.
Cuban troops who fought South African forces in Angola say they have done their duty and are ready to leave under an accord intended to secure independence for Namibia and peace in this war-torn nation.
The 450 troops, officers and non-commissioned officers form the first group of a contingent of 3,000 Cubans who must leave Angola by April 1 under terms of the accord signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
All Cuban troops, estimated at 50,000 to 52,000, must be out of Angola by July 1, 1991.
``We've done our duty, we've helped the Angolan people.
Now it's time to go home and resume our studies,'' said Daniel Felipe Manero, a 21-year-old anti-aircraft gunner from Matanza, Cuba who spent two years at a base in Menongue in southern Angola.
Manero and other soldiers met reporters Sunday at the Futungo transit camp outside the Angolan capital.
Cuban government spokeswoman Eurina Cabral said the 450 will leave Tuesday for Havana following a ceremony to be attended by top-ranking Cuban military officials, including Deputy Armed Forces Minister Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra.
Cuba's military involvement in Angola began in 1975 with Operation Carlota, an airlift of troops to back the fledgling government of the Angolan Popular Liberation Movement just after Angola gained independence from Portugal.
Immediately after independence, the Cuban-aided forces began fighting South African- and U.S.-supported rebels of UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for control of the country.
There is some question of how a U.N. observer force of 70 military officials and 20 civilians will actually monitor the departures of tens of thousands of Cubans from several ports and airports around the country.
``What is important is that it has been agreed the Cubans should leave,'' the U.N. observer force chief, Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes, said in an interview.
``In what kind of transporter or how many at a time are just details.''
``We are relying on the good word of both countries (Angola and Cuba) and the important thing is they are agreeing to the withdrawal,'' he said.
Angola and Cuba have asked the United Nations to pick up the $800 million tab for the Cuban pullout, which Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has said will proceed at a rate of 2,500-3,000 soldiers per month.
Ms. Cabral said she had no details on who was paying what, but ``something is certainly being worked out.''
She also asked for the remains of all Cubans killed in Angola to be returned to Cuba.
She could not supply casualty figures, but some Western intelligence sources put the figure at about 5,000.
Throughout the war, the policy has been to bury the Cuban dead in Angola.
Under an Aug. 22 cease-fire, South African forces withdrew from southern Angola across the border to Namibia, a territory administered by Pretoria since World War I. But Angola's rebel UNITA forces were not party to U.S.-brokered talks that led to the cease-fire, and they continue to skirmish with Angolan troops.
The United States says it will continue to help UNITA until both sides in the civil war sit down and talk, something President dos Santos says is out of the question.
Gen. Venancio Avila Guerrero, commander of Cuban troops at the decisive battle of Cuito Cuanavale this spring, when the Cubans routed South African forces in southern Angola, said he had no doubts Angola's government forces would be able to handle the battle with UNITA alone.
``They've been ready for years.
They can take care of this and morale is high,'' he said as Cuban troops, some of them women with their hair in rollers, played a game of volleyball in the scorching midday sun.
UNITA representatives claim many Cuban soldiers will remain in the country as Angolan citizens married to local women.
``That's total lie.
There's not one Cuban married to an Angolan woman or staying here,'' said Lt. Jesus Abad from Pinar del Rio in eastern Cuba.
``We're professionals who came to do a job, and now we're leaving.''
Army reservist Olga Lidia Rodriguez Proenza was 20 when she arrived in Angola from her hometown of Hologuin two years ago as a volunteer in a public health team.
Like many others at the camp, some of whom have also served in Nicaragua and Ethiopia, she said she planned to resume studies in pharmacy once back in Cuba.
The government said Saturday it will ask the United States to help battle an electricity shortage that has reduced working hours, curtailed transportation and even trimmed television broadcasts.
Public Works Minister Rodolfo Terragno, who is traveling in the United States, is to meet with U.S. energy officials on Tuesday in Washington, the state-owned news agency Telam said in a communique.
Terragno also will seek World Bank financing to accelerate the completion of a large thermoelectric station in Bahia Blanca, 418 miles southwest of Buenos Aires.
There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Embassy.
A month ago, the government took steps to curtail electricity consumption, including rotating power cuts of up to six hours a day, reduced street lighting, and cutbacks in the hours of operation of subways and television stations.
Even clocks were set ahead by one hour.
Hundreds of thousands of state workers were given Friday and Monday off with pay as government offices closed in response to temperatures in the mid 90s and lack of air conditioners.
The government attributes the situation to drought, which lowered water levels in the rivers that feed Argentina's hydroelectric projects; and to equipment breakdowns at several fossil fuel power stations.
Also, the smaller of the country's two commercial nuclear reactors is out of service.
Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party's candidate for president, attributes the situation to the government's ``lack of foresight, the lack of responsibility and lack of ability to manage the energy sector that is so important.''
The Department of Energy calculated two weeks ago that of a total installed capacity of 12,118 megawatts, the national power grid was producing only 2,500 kilowatts.
The situation has wreaked havoc with daily life.
The stock exchange suspended operations briefly last Thursday, newspapers have missed press runs, people have been stranded in elevators, sections of the capital are without water due to the shutdown of electric pumps.
``We are really close to a blackout,'' the president of the state-run electric utility Segba, Pablo Caravelli, said.
Official trade unions have pledged to strike and mount other protests if wage and social reforms fail to offset price increases planned by the government, a union newspaper said Saturday.
Also Saturday, an apartment renters' group asked the government in an open letter to refrain from planned increases in water and sewage costs in order not to aggravate social tensions.
The two separate reactions to the government's program were a clear indication that it will face difficulties in imposing price boosts of up to 15 percent on a variety of goods and services.
A quarter of consumer prices are to go up in the near future, government spokesman Gyerogy Marosan announced on Jan. 2. The increases will affect food, transportation, water, and home-heating fuels.
The trade union daily Nepszava reported that a Friday session of leaders of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions said, ``The successive price increases have touched off social tensions that absolutely require state authorities to take concrete steps in coming months to work out and introduce, as soon as possible, a wage and social policy reform.''
In the open letter to Premier Miklos Nemeth, the leaders of the Association of Apartment Renters strongly rejected planned water and sewage rate boosts.
The letter, quoted by the daily Magyar Nemzet, referred to ``a situation where the rents actually paid for apartments, shops, offices, workshops, storeroom ... more than cover the costs of maintenance, and a profit of about 400 million forints (about $8 million) has been amassed by the offices handling this (state) property.''
Referring to ``responsible politicians'' predicting social tensions, the association said, ``We question the correctness of deepening this further by increasing the sums payable by renters in this unjustified, unfounded and unjust and unlawful manner.''
Tornadoes tore through several Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky towns Saturday, injuring more than 40 people and destroying a third of the homes and commercial buildings in this town, officials said.
The tornado cut through a 10-square-block area and ``most homes are flattened and businesses are destroyed'' in that area, said Wabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds from an emergency command post in the local bank.
About 35 percent of the town's 275 buildings were demolished and half were damaged to some extent, said Grounds.
Mayor Jack Loeffler estimated that six to eight people had been temporarily trapped ``in rubble, but I think they've all been rescued.''
He said all but four or five people had been accounted for by mid-evening in the town of 600, and emergency workers searched door-to-door to make sure no one remained trapped.
Allendale is three miles from the Indiana border, about 130 miles east of St. Louis.
``There were numerous injuries, but as far as we know, no fatalities,'' said Trooper Harry Sutton of the Illinois State Police.
The only fire house in the rural community was destroyed and the only school was heavily damaged, according to Grounds.
June Lofton, spokeswoman for Wabash General Hospital in nearby Mount Carmel, said 39 people, including at least six children, were treated for injuries ranging from cuts and scratches to spinal injuries.
``We're talking about people who were buried under buildings ... major injuries,'' she said.
Lofton said at least 10 people were admitted and six were transferred to other area hospitals.
``People's houses were blown away with them in them,'' Lofton said.
``It's really been quite a disaster.''
Gerald Waldroup, administrator of Lawrence County Memorial Hospital, about 25 miles north of Allendale, said five people were brought to the emergency room.
Four were treated for scratches and cuts.
The fifth, an 18-month-old boy with a head injury, was transferred to an Indiana hospital.
Minutes before the tornado stuck Allendale, twisters hit nearby Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said.
A tornado later struck an area south of Vincennes, Ind., but Allendale appeared to have been hit the worst, they said.
Thunderstorms moved into Missouri, Indiana and Illinois, producing golf ball-size hail near Carbondale, Ill., and near Washington, Ind., the National Weather Service said.
The storm system, which originated in Illinois, appeared to have lost strength as it moved in a northeasterly direction through southwestern Indiana, authorities said.
Near Vincennes, which is on the Illinois border 40 miles north of Evansville, two people were treated for minor cuts at Good Samaritan Hospital in Vincennes after their mobile home south of the city was blown over, said hospital nursing supervisor Janet Sheirmann.
Knox County Sheriff Don Kirkum said the tornado struck an area southeast of the city known as Saint Thomas about 6:45 p.m.
``Damaged or destroyed were approximately 30 homes and 25 to 30 farm buildings,'' Kirkum said in a statement released to the media about 11:30 p.m. ``Most power and telephones are not operable at this time, and it is not known how long it will be before service is restored.''
In the Indiana town, children wept inside a car outside their home, which appeared to have been destroyed with its roof and sides ripped away.
It was one of at least half a dozen homes damaged along a single road in Vincennes.
``I don't know what it was,'' said the man inside the car.
The storm struck Vincennes Lincoln High School on the city's southside and knocked out power during a junior varsity basketball game.
The remainder of the game and the varsity contest that was to have followed were postponed.
Dispatcher Bob Street of the Martin County Sheriff's Department said extra officers were on duty ``in case something happens.''
A spokesman for the Starke County sheriff's department said it had received reports of homes damaged near Knox.
In Kentucky, officials said a tornado touched down in the south-central town of Franklin late Saturday night, causing some damage to businesses and homes.
A dispatcher for the Franklin City Police said a Ford autodealership was ``practically destroyed'' and several apartment buildings were damaged in the east and south ends of the community of 7,700.
There were no initial reports of injuries or fatalities.
The National Weather Service in Louisville said the tornado was reported about 10:38 p.m.
Meanwhile in Wisconsin, thick fog covered much of the state, interfering with airport travel in the area.
At 6 p.m., visibility was reduced to a quarter mile at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee.
Airport spokesmen said some flights were diverted or delayed, affecting about 80 percent of the day's normal traffic.
The Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball team could not get home by plane from Baltimore because of fog at Mitchell and Chicago's O'Hare airport, team spokesman Bill King said.
The players landed instead at Grand Rapids, Mich., ``the nearest they could get,'' and resumed their trip by bus, King said.
It meant postponement by at least an hour of Saturday night's game in Milwaukee against the Utah Jazz.
The Soviet Union will start destroying its massive stockpiles of chemical weapons this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced Sunday.
Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union is finishing construction of a plant to eliminate chemical arms that will go into operation this year.
Representatives of other countries will be invited to visit the facility, he said.
He did not elaborate.
He said that some might ask whether the Soviet Union waited too long to stop production and the answer would be: ``Yes, we did, in fact wait too long ... We are quickly making up for time lost over the past two years.''
The Soviet position has ``changed quite radically'' in recent years, Shevardnadze said.
The Soviet Union has gone from ``manufacturing to abandoning altogether'' chemical weapons.
``In the course of the year 1989, we will begin elimination of chemical weapons stockpiles at a facility built for that purpose,'' he said.
In April 1987, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his country had stopped manufacturing chemical weapons.
In October, the Soviet Union destroyed some chemical weapons in front of a group of Western observers, but this was done to illustrate openess on the subject and not as part of a program to begin destroying the toxic agents.
The United States and the Soviet Union have been the only countries to acknowledge producing and stockpiling chemical weapons.
The United States says it produces the arms to counter those produced by the Soviets.
In 1987, the Soviet Union declared it had 50,000 tons of chemical weapons.
Western military experts put Soviet stockpiles at between 100,000 and 500,000 tons.
The United States has about 30,000 tons, officials say.
After an 18-year lapse, the United States resumed production of chemical weapons in December 1987, saying that much of its aging stockpile was obsolete.
Shevardnadze called on other countries to end production of chemical weapons.
Without referring to the United States by name, he said, ``there is another country that possesses equally significant chemical weapons stockpiles and who could share with us the task of finding compromise solutions in the interest of comprehensive and global verfication.''
The United States also has invited the Soviet Union to inspect a facility used for eliminating obsolete chemical weapons, but the Soviets have not accepted the invitation.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union wants to see a convention banning use, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons signed this year.
Negotiators have been at work in Geneva for 17 years on such a convention, but an accord has been blocked over a variety of problems, especially verification.
A 1925 Geneva Protocol, the only existing accord, only bans the use of chemical weapons, not their production or storage, and has no enforcement power.
The Paris conference, attended by 145 nations, aims to reaffirm the Geneva Protocol and press negotiators in Geneva to conclude successful negotiations on a global ban.
Iran has condemned Iraq for using chemical arms in the Persian Gulf war, the most recent verified use of the weapons.
The United States has accused Libya of constructing a chemical weapons plant, but Libya says the plant at Rabta is for manufacturing pharmaceuticals.
General Douglas MacArthur and others directing the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S. and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonment or exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion poll seven weeks before the end of the war.
Some allied governments had similar views.
MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch who died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation, dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige for his country.
Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.
Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.
Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decided retention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America and other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military command, the documents showed.
George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American'' thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of those questioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prison the rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him.
Only 4 percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said ``use him as a puppet to run Japan.''
Other replies or no opinion accounted for 23 percent.
MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the monarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945.
Hands trembling, the emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur wrote, adding that ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in his Own Right.''
Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington that Hirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion, potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan.
One million occupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.
George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is most useful.
He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was Hugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the war on occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said the committee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a continuation of the war.''
First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might be retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress.
Sen. Tom Stewart, D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd like to see him hung up by his toes.''
Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to be treated like Hitler.''
Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessful resolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''
But Sens.
Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by working through the emperor.
President Reagan's submission today of his $1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work schedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers and then routinely ignored.
This year should be no different.
The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spending plan by April 15.
In addition, all 13 appropriations bills that finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this year.
Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bush after his inauguration.
The House Budget Committee isn't even planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait instead until it receives something from Bush.
In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the additional revenues will be unavoidable.
``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where the likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usual pledges to move quickly on the budget.
Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said, ``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall perform our work on time.''
And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waive the provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
But history shows that fiscal and political crises, not timetables, govern the budget process.
Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences if they are missed.
But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls ``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
Sometime this August or September, the government is expected to reach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.
At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin that ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
Those cuts -- which are seen by most people as draconian -- would take effect Oct. 1.
In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year.
Some sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1 or the government cannot function.
Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the blueprint is the most basic statement of the government's priorities.
It not only perpetually creates institutional struggles between the executive and legislative branches, but it is a battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselves for future elections.
Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the crucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash.
It was the first year in 12 in which all 13 spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.
In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.
The city manager is on the verge of flipping a switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this northern Ohio town.
But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplies electricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal power system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually increase and surpass their rates.
City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power Co. is a gamble.
``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to provide electricity.
It turned out that it is going to be cheaper and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in a recent interview.
But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start negotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to serve the city.
The contract expires in June 1990.
Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles southeast of Toledo.
Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annually in revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart, general manager of the utility's eastern district.
The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio.
``Losing Clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution system,'' he said.
The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings five years ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills double.
Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to set up the utility company.
Early last year, the city agreed to buy power wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 cents per kilowatt hour.
The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but the company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.
Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution and transmission lines.
Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents per kilowatt hour.
The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average household pays $52 a month.
That's expected to drop to $39.
More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems, most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal system has been set up since the early 1900s.
Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohio municipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been set and Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
But there are several inherent problems with municipal power systems, Everhart said.
In coming years, some cities may have trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, the utility company official said.
``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blows hard, until there is a major accident and until something goes wrong.
And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,'' said Everhart.
A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126 people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76, officials said.
The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled out sabotage.
The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot the runway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into an embankment and broke apart, police said.
Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft came in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it careened toward the highway.
Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.
``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of this accident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,'' Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news conference.
He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or alive.
It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane, since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the highway.
After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of England's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery, the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.
Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodies scattered on each side of the highway.
Two nearby hospitals reported a total of 76 people injured.
``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50, who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was among the first on the scene.
He helped rescue several people and saw many bodies in the wreckage.
``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames.
It was horrendous.''
The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.
The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in three weeks.
On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
That jet had also left Heathrow.
A bomb was blamed for the crash.
The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. and its engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transport said.
The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it was clear that there would be an accident,'' airport official Michael Cowan told a news conference.
`As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was too low,'' he said.
Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and there was nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the engines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the London-Belfast route, he said.
The weather was reported good.
The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mile outside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the Leicestershire police said.
The tail section was embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated Press.
But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.
The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines converged on the scene.
Cries for help could be heard from inside the fuselage.
Personal belongings littered the highway.
Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain from the wreckage to the ambulances.
They flattened trees and hacked open the fuselage.
The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick brambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
The pilot, Capt.
Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multiple injuries, British Midland said.
A local vicar, the Rev.
Michael Brandon, said he held a passenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.
``It was very dignified and peaceful.
There is not a lot more you can do in a situation like this,'' he said.
The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house just before it hit the ground.
``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead we saw the left engine still on fire.
Then we heard this pop, which could have been the crash.
Then we heard the fire engines,'' she told Independent Radio News.
Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's main runway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring and roaring away ... An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``There are still people trapped and work is going on to free them.
From the reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage.
It's a hell of a mess.''
British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said the pilot reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked clearance for an emergency landing at the airport.
Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12 weeks ago.
Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble climbing.
The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control radar screens at 8:15 p.m.
The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer fuselage and can carry 146 passengers.
It was introduced last year.
Political parties are struggling to emerge in this British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy, public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereignty over the territory in 1997.
Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to hold Hong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.
The organizations will be different from Western-style political parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign government.
Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for this capitalist enclave after 1997.
``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of Hong Kong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300 members that views itself as a future party.
In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, have announced plans to form political parties.
Councilor Maria Tam's Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.
Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which is primarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and his advisers.
The council now consists of government officials, government appointees and representatives of interest groups and local advisory boards.
The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quite sure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
But the groups will face huge problems in gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, who traditionally distrust political parties.
Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad 20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution.
Both parties operate unofficially in Hong Kong.
``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo, and they are afraid of political activities, political confrontation,'' Cheng said.
Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declared itself a political party for so long because ``all through the years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.''
Cheong rejects the ``party'' label for his new group.
Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing.
He said ``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in getting the kids to school.
Their understanding of issues is still in a very inchoate stage.''
Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition, according to Lee.
That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset of legislative elections that China has promised will continue after 1997.
Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said early this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory effectively allows political parties.
Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their leaders.
Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's first chief executive, which will be the top local post after the British leave.
Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate of sweeping democratic reform.
Three-year-old Meeting Point's goals include a high degree of self administration for the territory after 1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies, Yeung said.
Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.
One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground to openly participate in elections.
``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,'' said Lee.
Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harris sees little hope for them to wield real power, noting that authoritarian Communist countries such as China do not accept challenges to their rule.
The landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel, a home away from home for six presidents and armies of celebrities since 1875, has closed for the first time since the great earthquake of 1906 for a $60 million, 18-month renovation.
``It's very strange.
It's very lonely,'' Donald Timbie, the hotel's general manager and vice president, said Monday as the hotel shut down.
The quake, which destroyed much of the city, triggered a fire which gutted the original, seven-story hotel.
But 12-foot-thick brick walls saved the shell and it was rebuilt to its current nine stories and reopened Dec. 16, 1909, with other alterations in 1915, 1919 and 1925.
Tenor Enrico Caruso was a guest as the temblor struck.
He was tossed from his bed and vowed, ``I will never set foot in San Francisco again.''
``Actually, the earthquake only destroyed 8 percent of the structure,'' said Jim Kilroy, the hotel's director of marketing.
``The fire did the rest.''
The hotel has been host to Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
Warren G. Harding died there, in room 8064 on Aug. 2, 1923.
Other notables who stayed at the Palace include Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Charles Lindberg, Amelia Earhart, Charlie Chaplin, Nikita Khrushchev and Winston Churchill.
President Woodrow Wilson gave his famous League of Nations speech there, and the Garden Court held the official banquet honoring the opening session of the United Nations.
King David Kalakaua of Hawaii, the last of the island's monarchs, died at the Palace on Jan. 20, 1891.
The hotel's exterior will not be altered.
Neither will the Garden Court, a 9,350-square-foot restaurant originally built as a carriage entrance.
It was declared a city landmark in 1969 and the only work there will involve a clean-up and a change in color scheme.
The last luncheon was held in the court Monday.
The San Francisco Opera Guild event drew about 12 people who sat at one table, dwarfed by the huge room that features an arching dome of iridescent glass.
The Market Street hotel, which has 525 guest rooms and 60 suites, will add a swimming pool and health spa, along with about 5,000 square feet of meeting space.
Market Street, which begins near San Francisco Bay and runs through the heart of the city's business district, has undergone a recent revival.
The repaving and renovation of six downtown blocks was completed late last year, and the opening last October of a lavish new Nordstrom department store a few blocks from the hotel has attracted visitors to the area.
On the sidelines of the world chemical weapons conference, experts say bleakly no headway has been made on the most worrisome threat: keeping the chemicals away from terrorists or leaders bent on genocide.
Sentiment aside, they say, poison gas works and it is nearly impossible to control its components without energetic, voluntary action by governments and private industry.
At the same time, they add, many small nations refuse to ban such weapons while neighbors have atomic bombs, the way a streetwise youth carries a switch-blade because of bullies down the block.
Few technicians among the 151 delegations attending the five-day Paris conference wanted to be named, leaving the limelight to statesmen drafting a declaration against producing and using chemical or biological weapons.
A European specialist summed up the mood: ``This conference is one thing.
Controlling the stuff is another.
You have to conclude that chemical weapons won the war for Iraq.
That sends a very strong negative message.''
Iraq acknowledged using poison gas in its eight-year war with Iraq, in which a cease-fire was reached Aug. 20.
An American expert said many Third World military strategists are seeking advice from Iraq, which he said had five years of experience with mustard gas and nerve gas.
Another U.S. specialist said gas and biological agents would remain effective against ``inconvenient minorities'' even if nations could be kept from using them outside their borders.
Iraq has been accused of using poison gas against rebellious Kurds.
Terrorists could wreak havoc with small amounts of nerve agents, without complex delivery systems.
Max Friedersdorf, U.S. envoy to the Geneva disarmament talks, agreed in an interview that a gulf exists between what probably will be negotiated and what can be applied.
``There is a technical gap, and 100 percent verification ... is almost impossible, but that doesn't mean we should not continue,'' he said.
Richard Perle, the former senior Defense Department official involved in negotiations, went further in a telephone interview from Washington.
``In this case, 100 percent non-verification is the fact,'' he said.
``You cannot control this.''
Perle and most experts agreed the only effective measure is to stop companies from exporting essential chemicals or helping other countries make weapons.
Although some poison gases are easy to make, they say, mass production and accurate delivery systems require sophisticated assistance.
``You cannot let yourself be put off by the hand thrower-uppers,'' one American delegate said.
``Of course it is hard, but the horse is not all the way out of the barn.
We have to do this fast.''
U.S. and West German specialists estimated 20 to 25 companies regularly sell chemicals to Third World countries making deadly agents, and about another 300 have made sales in recent years.
They said most of the companies were West German.
The only control now is the informal Australia Suppliers Group, representatives of 19 nations who meet regularly in Paris to discuss possible dangerous sales by private suppliers.
``We have to rely on each country to provide information and take action,'' said a delegate who regularly attends those meetings.
``Our effect is limited.''
Even with the best of political will it would take two to three years to agree on a treaty and 10 more to eliminate chemical weapons, he said, and ``that is a long time to keep up political pressure.''
West German authorities say they want to prevent dangerous exports but are hampered by lack of an international code.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, addressing the conference, appealed for a ban on chemical weapons combined with mandatory inspections on 48 hours notice in cases of suspicion.
U.S. negotiators first suggested such challenge inspections in 1984, Perle said, but subsequent study showed that, ``in a matter of days, even hours, all evidence can be removed.''
He added, referring to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi: ``Even if an accord were reached for investigators to leave the moment they had a suspicion, who in their right mind would believe that someone like Colonel Gadhafi would allow it to happen?''
The United States accuses Libya of building a chemical weapons plant with the help of a West Germany company.
Libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory.
Perle said the West Germans should police their own exporters.
``They allow their companies to get involved in this, cover it up and go around lecturing us,'' he said.
Another American delegate commented: ``It is not an accident that people as efficient as the Germans cannot control these people.''
The new year at the box office began right where 1988 finished, with ``Rain Man'' and ``Twins,'' a pair of films about brothers, battling for the No. 1 position in the nation's theaters.
First out of the gate was the poignant road movie ``Rain Man,'' which led all other films with weekend ticket sales of $9.2 million.
For the second week in a row, ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an autistic savant kidnapped by his scheming brother (Tom Cruise), finished ahead of the domestic comedy ``Twins,'' according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
``Twins,'' featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as siblings separated at birth, finished second with $7.1 million.
The critically acclaimed ``The Accidental Tourist,'' in its first week of wide release, landed in third place with $6.1 million.
The film, an adaptation of Anne Tyler's bittersweet novel of the same name, stars William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.
In fourth was ``Working Girl,'' the Wall Street success story with Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford, which collected $5 million.
The comedies ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!''
and ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' finished fifth and sixth, respectively.
``The Naked Gun,'' featuring Leslie Nielsen as a bumbling police detective, drew $4.7 million.
``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' with Steve Martin and Michael Caine as dueling con men, grossed $3.5 million.
In seventh place was Robert Towne's ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring Mel Gibson as a drug dealer trying to go straight, with sales of $3 million.
Next was the animated film ``Oliver and Co.,'' the Oliver Twist-inspired tale of a homeless kitten, which got $2.6 million.
Rounding out the top 10 were the Bill Murray comedy ``Scrooged,'' collecting $1.5 million, and the horror movie ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' with $1.4 million.
Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.

A new surgeon general's report on smoking scheduled for release this week increases the estimate of smoking-related deaths by 30 percent to 390,000 a year, The Christian Science Monitor reported Monday.
The report, which comes 25 years after the first surgeon general's report on smoking, also cites cigarette smoking as the cause for nine out of 10 lung cancer deaths among women, the newspaper said.
Other conclusions in the report by Dr. C. Everett Koop are that lung cancer now surpasses breast cancer as the leading cancer killer among women, 43 chemicals in tobacco are now confirmed as cancer causing and smoking is a major cause of cerebral vascular disease.
Koop's increase in his estimate of smoking-related deaths from 300,000 annually is due to more accurate accounting rather than more lethal cigarettes, The Monitor said in a release it distributed two days before the report was to have been made public.
Koop estimates that 50 million Americans still smoke, the newspaper said.
Children, especially girls, are smoking at younger ages, the Monitor quoted the report as saying, with 80 percent of smokers born since 1935 starting before the age of 21, despite state age restrictions on the purchase of cigarettes.
However, Koop found that in 1987, nearly half of all adults who had smoked had quit, with the trend particularly true among men.
Before the report was issued, the Tobacco Institute began a campaign in newspapers around the country.
In ads headlined, ``Enough is enough,'' the institute said the results of a nationwide poll it commissioned shows that the majority of Americans do not want an increase in cigarette taxes, more smoking bans or the elimination of cigarette advertising.
Astronomers have spotted a star as it devoured its companion orb, and perhaps solved a celestial mystery.
Scientists have long argued about how some superdense stars called pulsars could get themselves spinning hundreds of times a second.
The question may now be answered by the discovery of a black widow binary -- a star that like the spider uses its companion and then destroys it.
If current theories are correct, the star represents a celestial missing link, a bridge between fast-spinning stars that have mates and those that do not.
The combination of the star and its companion, labeled PSR 1957-20 in astronomers' shorthand, was detected last spring by Andrew Fruchter of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
At a meeting Monday of the American Astronomical Society, scientists described the significance of the find in understanding the life and death of the stars.
The duo is made up of a pulsar, an incredibly dense dead star that transmits rhythmic beats of radar.
It is orbited by a much larger ordinary star known as a brown dwarf.
Astronomers have evidence that the pulsar is transmitting a powerful blast of energy that is literally blowing its companion away.
They believe this is the late phase of a long, one-sided relationship between the two in which the pulsar steals matter from its mate to boost its speed, then turns on it with a blaze of atomic particles.
``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio of Cornell University.
``It is constantly losing matter.
Eventually it could completely disappear.''
The pulsar is one of six known pulsars that spin extremely rapidly.
The newly discovered pair is important because they seem to help explain how they get to spin so fast.
``It offers a missing link between two classes of objects,'' said Steve Maran of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
``That's why astronomers are so excited.''
A pulsar is the collapsed remains of a large star that has exploded in a spectacular disaster called a supernova.
Pulsars emit no light, but broadcast twin rotating beams of radar, like lighthouses in the sky.
While a pulsar is only 14 miles across, its mass is 50 percent greater than the sun.
One teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions of tons.
Most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down.
However, the newly discovered one spins about 600 times a second.
Astronomers theorize that such fast-moving pulsars speed up by stealing a stream of matter from a companion star.
The companion ``spins up the pulsar like a top,'' said Fruchter.
However, astronomers have noticed while some of these fast-spinning pulsars have companions, others do not.
``People wondered, `If you spin up the pulsar with a companion, where is the companion?'''
said Fruchter.
``This may explain that.
The pulsar has evaporated the companion.''
In the newly spotted couple, the companion is close to the pulsar, a distance of only 2{ times the sun's diameter.
Yet it is being bombarded with atomic particles 5,000 times more intense than the sun.
Astronomers were able to study the pair because the companion regularly eclipses the pulsar.
The companion revolves around the pulsar once every nine hours, and each time it blocks out the pulsar's radar beam for about 50 minutes.
``This is the only one (mate-eating pulsar) that we have seen in the galaxy,'' said E. Sterl Phinney of the California Institute of Technology.
``But there is the exciting possibility that there will be many more.''
Liberace's ex-lover testified Tuesday that a convicted drug dealer spoke of a ``bloody mess'' after a 1981 quadruple murder and said, ``The whole thing got out of hand.''
Scott Thorson said defendant Eddie Nash also told him he was going to teach a lesson to a group of people who had robbed him, saying, ``I'll have these people on their knees.''
Nash, 59, whose real name is Adel Nasrallah, and his bodyguard Gregory Diles, 40, are charged with the Laurel Canyon slayings in which sex-film star John Holmes once was tried and acquitted.
Witnesses at the current preliminary hearing said Nash was robbed of cash, drugs and jewelry by two subsequent murder victims.
Witness David Lind, who participated in the robbery, said Nash fell to his knees and asked for time to pray, assuming he would be killed.
Scott Thorson, 29, who was Liberace's companion from 1977 to 1982, said he became close friends with Nash after he bought cocaine from him in early 1981.
He said he wound up living at Nash's house when Liberace evicted him in 1982.
At the end of June 1981, Thorson recalled, he went to Nash's house to buy cocaine.
Soon, he said, Diles appeared with Holmes in tow.
Diles took Holmes into a bedroom, Thorson said, adding he was told to leave but listened outside the door.
``Eddie (Nash) was screaming at the top of his lungs,'' Thorson said. ``... He threatened that he would kill John Holmes' family and he would kill him if he didn't take him to the home of the people who robbed him.''
Diles and Holmes left and Nash said that he had sent Diles ``to get his property'' Thorson said.
Later, Thorson said, Nash sank into a depression and went on a drug binge.
During one of those sessions, Thorson said Nash confided in him.
``He discussed ... Wonderland (the street on which the murders occurred) and he had gone a little too far,'' said Thorson.
``He used the term, `a bloody mess,''' said Thorson.
``He said the whole thing got out of hand.''
``Did he say he had the murders done?''
asked Deputy District Attorney Dale Davidson.
``He didn't come right out and say it,'' said Thorson. ``... He said they were pinning the murders on him.''
The victims, Ronald Launius, 37, Roy DeVerell, 42, Barbara Richardson, 22, and Joy Audrey Miller, 46, were bludgeoned to death on July 1, 1981, about two days after Lind said Nash was robbed.
Launius' wife, Susan, survived the attack but was never able to identify her attacker.
Holmes died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome last March.
Thorson made headlines when he sued Liberace for $12 million claiming the entertainer reneged on a promise to support him for life.
Liberace died of AIDS in 1987.
President Reagan is leaving office proposing a truce in his battle with the United Nations and a boost in arms aid to friendly nations, but tossing the question of Nicaragua's Contra rebels to successor George Bush.
Reagan's foreign policy positions were reflected in the fiscal 1990 budget plan he sent to Congress on Monday.
Officials say his $13.2 billion foreign aid spending budget should remain relatively unchanged by the new Bush administration.
Consistent with past practice, there was no request for Contra assistance in Reagan's final budget.
The president routinely has treated that issue separately, and this time it will be Bush's decision.
Another difficult problem to be resolved by Bush is what to do about the bug-riddled new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow.
In his budget plan for next year, Reagan proposed to give the United Nations and other international organizations the full U.S. share of their budgets for the first time since 1986.
In addition, Reagan proposed to throw in $46 million as a downpayment on the $572 million in cumulative U.S. arrears to international organizations.
Reagan has held back part of the one-fourth U.S. share of U.N. financing since 1986 to protest what he charged was the world body's wasteful bureaucracy and anti-American tone.
The budget document pronounced that pressure successful and said the organization has reformed enough to warrant a reward.
Of the $14.8 billion in total foreign aid budget authority Reagan asked for next year, military assistance to U.S. allies comes to slightly more than $5 billion, about 7 percent over the current year.
As he has in the past, Reagan sought to convert loan programs for military sales into straight grants.
Direct economic aid to friendly nations would amount to $3.3 billion, a slight increase from the current figure.
As usual, Israel and Egypt were the two largest recipients of proposed aid.
Israel was earmarked for $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic assistance, or $3 billion in total spending authority.
Egypt was proposed to receive $2.3 billion, including $1.3 billion for military purposes and $815 million in economic aid.
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said Bush's nominee for secretary of state, James A. Baker III, had not been consulted about the budget made public Monday.
But Whitehead said that ``I have no reason to believe there will be any sharp differences'' in the new administration over the Reagan budget proposals.
George P. Shultz plans to cancel his last official trip overseas - to a human rights conference in Vienna - unless Greece gives ground in a dispute over how much of Turkey should be covered by an East-West arms control agreement.
A decision by the Secretary of State to stay home also means he would miss a 32nd and final meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
At the root of this uncertainty is an effort by the Greek government to expose more Turkish territory to conventional arms control coverage.
Boundaries have been drawn for conventional arms control negotiations designed to follow the close of the rights conference, but Greece, suspicious of Turkey and fretful about Cyprus, is holding out.
Everyone else in the 16-nation NATO alliance has agreed on the precise expanse of Europe to be covered in the Conventional Stability Talks with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce troops, tanks and artillery across the European landscape.
But unless a compromise is struck with Athens and its mercurial prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, the Vienna conference - which makes its decisions by consensus - cannot close and negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact will be put off indefinitely.
The rights conference, which opened in November 1986, has reviewed compliance with the Helsinki agreement.
The 35-nation accord signed in the Finnish capital in 1975 provided for human rights improvements and a lessening of tensions between East and West.
The arms control talks are covered by the conference because they aim at reducing those tensions.
The end of the Vienna conference would set the stage for the opening within weeks of the arms control talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
The United States and Moscow had agreed in 1983 that the area to be covered by reductions would stretch from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
But it took years of negotiations to define the area more exactly.
NATO wanted to include the Caucasus mountain region in the Soviet Union.
The Warsaw Pact wanted the U.S. air base at Incirlik, Turkey, covered, as well.
Turkey, meanwhile, stretches from Europe, the focus of the negotiations, to Asia, which is not part of the mandate.
The Turks are nervous about three of their neighbors, Iran, Syria and Iraq, and have tensions with Greece over Cyprus to the south.
They would like to keep as many men under arms as they can.
The Turkish army invaded Cyprus in 1974 and still holds about one-third of the island where Turkey set up a separate state that only Ankara recognizes as legitimate.
The Greek Cypriots, who are in the majority on the island and have Greece's support, want the Turks to withdraw.
In Vienna, a deal was struck between Turkey and the Soviet Union.
It excluded a large area along Turkey's southern coast from the negotiations - thereby guaranteeing that Turkish forces in the area would not be part of any reduction NATO and the Warsaw Pact work out.
NATO went along with the deal, but Greece did not.
Papandreou's government wanted more of Turkish territory and southern ports included in the arms control negotiations.
Greece's goal is to reduce Turkish forces facing Cyprus.
The United States is not directly involved in the dispute.
``We've always felt the working out should be done by the Soviets and the Turks,'' said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But he stressed that the Greeks, who initially accepted the exclusion of an even larger area of Turkey from the negotiations, were at odds with all of NATO.
``Everybody was taken aback when they changed their position,'' the official said.
There is still some time to reach a settlement before Shultz's scheduled departure for Vienna on Sunday.
But the time is running short.
The war on drugs outranked cutting the deficit as President Reagan proposed a 14 percent increase in the money spent to beat back the tide of illegal narcotics in the United States.
``I think this clearly gives the message that drug law enforcement remains a priority of this government and this administration,'' said John C. Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The DEA would add 164 agents and more than 100 supporting workers if the proposed outlays are approved by Congress.
The total outlay requested Monday for fiscal 1990 starting Oct. 1 is more than $5 billion for all the agencies involved in prevention, treatment and law enforcement.
That reflects a $633 million increase over the $4.4 billion to be spent in the current fiscal year.
The DEA expects to increase arrests by more than 1,100 in 1990, the government said in budget documents.
Of the $5 billion proposed for spending on drug-related matters in 1990, some $3.5 billion would go for law enforcement, $915 million for drug abuse prevention and $633 million for treatment programs, according to an administration official who has seen the documents summarizing the proposed drug-related budgets of all federal agencies.
The U.S. Customs Service, for which Reagan is seeking outlays of $415 million, ``will greatly expand the number of intensive examinations of high-risk containerized cargo shipments,'' the budget documents said.
Meanwhile, the Coast Guard would get an additional $47 million to pay for two surveillance aircraft and two land-based balloons to help spot drug smugglers, according to the documents.
The government said the addition of 940 positions proposed for the U.S. Attorneys' office is expected to increase the number of drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3,600 cases.
In addition, money has been requested to fund 6,685 new prison and jail bed spaces as well as leasing authority for 1,160 more.
FBI Director William S. Sessions noted that ``the bureau's national drug strategy is aligned purely to go after major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations and heroin and cocaine.''
``So with us, every incremental increase means that we can attack that many more organizations,'' said Sessions, referring to a proposed $12 million boost in FBI spending on drugs next year.
When the FBI received $15 million more as a result of the 1986 drug bill, ``I indicated that I felt that we could attack anywhere between 5 and 10 percent more that a current one-third to 40 percent of approximately 450 major drug trafficking organizations,'' Sessions said at a Justice Department news conference.
``We feel that with the allocations we have received -- that is the positions we've received of 128 agents and 159 support -- we'll be able to make a significant increase and impact on major drug trafficking organizations,'' Sessions said.
Deputy Attorney General Harold G. Christensen, asked whether the proposed increase were enough to convey the administration's seriousness about the war on drugs, said, ``I think that this program, given the constraints, does address that problem.''
The newly created office of drug czar would get $3.5 million and would be able to control up to $136 million in forfeitures of property seized in drug-related cases.
Within the law enforcement category, interdiction efforts would receive the largest allocation: $1.22 billion.
Also proposed to receive hefty amounts would be corrections facilities including prisons and support for prisoners, $722.3 million; investigations, $716.4 million; prosecutions, $306.7 million and international programs, $238.3 million.
The departments or agencies that would receive significant amounts of money to battle illegal drugs under the budget proposal are the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, $897.5 million; Coast Guard, $646.9 million; federal prisons, $614.4 million, with authorization for $664 million; the Drug Enforcement Administration, $522 million; and the U.S. Customs Service, $415 million.
Other agencies for which substantial amounts for drug work are proposed are the Education Department, $344.7 million; Defense Department, $323.8 million; U.S. Marshals Service, $148.4 million; State Department, $112 million; U.S. attorneys, $112.2 million; and the FBI, $87.4 million.
When President-elect Bush sits down later this week with his Cabinet choices, the question is whether there will be an empty seat at the table.
A top adviser conceded Monday that the search for a Secretary of Energy has proven more difficult than the transition team anticipated.
Craig Fuller, vice presidential chief of staff as well as co-director of the transition, said it was taking longer to fill the job because ``there are real technical difficulties and it's fraught with a lot of political problems.''
One of the political problems was the furor that knocked James Schlesinger, an early choice for the post, out of contention.
Fuller acknowledged that Gov. William Clements of Texas, among others, strongly opposed the choice of Schlesinger, defense secretary under President Ford and energy secretary under President Carter.
Schlesinger and Clements became bitter enemies when they were the two top Pentagon officials.
But Fuller insisted that Clements ``did not cause anybody to be put on or be taken off the list by himself.''
A new name circulating for the energy post was Harold Brown, defense secretary under Carter.
Fuller said Bush planned to meet with his Cabinet designees on Thursday.
The president-elect has named people to head 13 of the 14 Cabinet departments.
One top adviser who turned down an offer of a White House job after weeks of agonizing was pollster Robert M. Teeter, who informed Bush that for personal and family considerations he preferred to remain in Michigan.
In a statement announcing his decision, Teeter said he had planned to return home after the presidential campaign.
Although the offer of a White House post ``presented me with a very difficult decision,'' Teeter said, ``I have decided to stand by my original decision.''
Fuller said Teeter, who recently sold his share in the polling firm Market Opinion Research, would ``be available for consultation'' on strategic planning, message and themes.
Fuller, who had hoped to be named White House chief of staff, also is returning to private business.
He and Teeter have been co-directors of the transition.
The chief of staff job went to New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.
Bush spoke to political supporters on Monday and urged them to act as talent scouts to fill thousands of administration jobs.
``We are staffing a mandate,'' Bush told the Presidential Personnel Advisory Committee.
``That mandate isn't a set of issues and policies picked out of a hat or chosen at random since Nov. 8.
``It's a program we've run a winning national campaign on, a program ratified in the light of intense national examination.''
Bush said that ``talk about an issue-less, mandate-less election is unfair to the intelligence of the American people.''
``Voters had strong opinions on the most important issues facing this country in the years to come,'' he said.
``Where they agreed more with my opponent on the issues he won their votes and where they agreed more with me, I did.''
He went on to point out he defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis by nearly 7 million votes while carrying 40 states.
He said he was ``looking for men and women -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- who understand what we understand about Election Day 1988.''
Bush said he was ``particularly concerned that our search reach regions, the men and women in America who are too often overlooked in such efforts, Americans who -- let's be frank -- our party has perhaps done too little to include in the past.''
``I want them too,'' he said.
``Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, disabled Americans.
Not as tokens, but as talent.
Not for show, but for strength of character and for skill.''
President Reagan wants Congress set aside money for the next wave of military weaponry and increase spending on Star Wars in a defense budget with little chance of winning approval as it is, say congressional leaders and defense experts.
Overall, the two-year budget the Reagan administration released Monday proposes an increase in defense spending by 2 percent above the rate of inflation with $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990 and $330.89 billion for 1991.
Outlays - the money to be spent during the 12 months of fiscal 1990 - total $303 billion, including $9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and research programs.
Outlays for fiscal 1991 amount to $314.4 billion.
President-elect Bush is expected to amend the Reagan budget after he takes office Jan. 20.
The vice president has talked about a budget request that matches inflation instead of providing real growth.
If Bush fails to change the budget, Congress will surely do so.
For the past four years, Congress has cut defense spending increases to levels below the rate of inflation.
The reaction from legislators to the latest Reagan budget indicates that this time will be no different.
``We know one thing about this defense budget, it isn't likely to be approved the way it was submitted - with an increase of 2 percent over and above inflation,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, in a statement he issued Friday.
``What we need to know before Congress can go to work is what George Bush wants in his defense budget.
I am eager not only to read the new president's lips on defense, but also his first defense message to Congress,'' Aspin said.
Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the budget is a ``good foundation,'' but reserved comment until further study.
Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are $94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million the next year for research on a new Navy anti-satellite weapon and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
The budget also calls for moving into production the new B-2 stealth bomber, the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile and a rail-mobile version of the giant MX intercontinental ballistic missile.
``What worries me is the hasty rush to the next generation of military hardware,'' said Gordon Adams, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent analysis group.
Congress is likely to question a budget that ``shaves the edges of readiness and sustainability,'' Adams said.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the administration made some hard choices in either canceling or delaying two dozen programs, but the budget will not weaken the nation's ability to defend itself.
``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budget is an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible course that allows the United States to maintain its current force structure and to acquire the weapons systems necessary to ensure our national security,'' he said.
The budget includes an increase in spending authority on the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars, from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in 1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remains unclear how quickly he will pursue the program.
Star Wars is a ``softball for cutting,'' according to Adams, who believes the inflated total will give Bush a chance to trim the budget by about $2 billion.
``SDI is destined to be no more than a research program,'' said John Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting down unneeded military bases, reduce the Defense Department's civilian workforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift more than two dozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.
Meanwhile, Reagan asked Congress for a small increase in funding for veterans' medical care and pensions as he proposed outlays of $29.9 billion for the new Department of Veterans Affairs.
Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefits and services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2 billion in fiscal 1989.
The budget for the new department, which assumes Cabinet status in March, calls for a $700 million increase.
Among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays for medical care, from $11.4 billion in 1989 to $11.5 billion in 1990.
Proposed outlays for total pensions are $4 billion, a $94 million increase over the estimated total for fiscal 1989.
With less than two weeks to go as one of the longest-serving cabinet officers in American history, Secretary of State George P. Shultz offered a rare glimpse of some of the things that try his patience.
It was a valedictory speech of sorts, delivered Monday night on the occasion of a ``farewell event'' for Shultz sponsored by a private group called the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs.
Shultz touched only peripherally on foreign affairs in the speech, focusing instead on the things that trouble him in Washington, where he has lived off and on for 30 years, more than 11 in the cabinets of Presidents Reagan and Nixon.
Some of Shultz's pet peeves:
--People who say that America is in decline.
``These are false prophets,'' Shultz said, contending that great powers that have declined were imperial, absolutist or dominated by ``tradition-bound classes.''
America, he said, is none of these because American democracy holds the potential for resilience and rejuvenation.
--Lie detector tests.
Within an office or department or any organization, Shultz said, putting trust in people will produce trustworthy people -- the foremost of many reasons against the widespread use of lie detector tests.
``Management through fear and intimidation,'' he said, ``is not the way to promote honesty and protect security.''
--People who leak and lie and don't know when to give up.
There's nothing wrong with fighting before a decision is reached, he said, but ``leaks and lies subvert honest discourse.''
Once decisions are made, they should be carried out, like it or not.
--Legislative sabotage.
As Shultz described it, ``dialogue between the branches cannot yield productive results when, no matter what the apparent agreement, any faction, any staffer, any subcommittee, any member of Congress can delay and impede even the will of the majority.''
--Bureaucratic encroachment.
The Defense Department shouldn't tell the State Department how to negotiate with the Soviets and ``the CIA shouldn't find policy more fun than intelligence and objective analysis -- because when it does, its intelligence and analytic products have no credibility.''
Shultz was too polite to name names, but his comments on the CIA seemed aimed primarily at agency's late director, William Casey, who was better known within the State Department establishment for his advocacy of hard-line policies than for disinterested analysis during his six years at the CIA.
As for the Pentagon's perceived encroachment on State's turf, there seems little doubt that Shultz had in mind former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, with whom Shultz had many a run-in.
Concerning those lawmakers who Shultz says don't play fair, none gave him a harder time than Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who singlehandedly was able to hold up confirmation of State Department appointees not to his liking for months at a time.
Casey, Weinberger and Helms all are known for their conservative views, but Shultz took on some liberals as well.
He expressed satisfaction that all the candidates who advocated protectionism (mostly Democratic presidential aspirants) last year were soundly defeated.
And he also seemed to have liberals in mind when he attacked the ``declinists'' -- people who espouse an American withdrawal from the world in order to regain economic or moral security.
``They play to the darker side, to the idea that America no longer has anything to give the world,'' Shultz said.
Despite the many disappointments and discouraging times Shultz encountered, he seems satisfied that most change has been for the better since he first came here.
``On the whole, the facts suggest optimism, especially optimism about America's future,'' he said.
``I find that while some things are worse, much is better.''
The prosecution in the trial of Oliver North says it has added to its witness list the names of a former congressman whom North is accused of misleading over aid to the Contras and beer magnate Joseph Coors, who says he gave the Nicaraguan rebels $65,000 after meeting with North.
Also on the revised list of prosecution witnesses against the fired National Security Council aide is William Langton, president of Southern Air Transport, a former CIA proprietary involved in both the Contra resupply operation and the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
The new names were on a list that actually contains fewer names, 40 rather than 87, reflecting a motion by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to dismiss the two central charges of conspiracy and theft against North.
But at a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he wouldn't dismiss the charges until Attorney General Dick Thornburgh explains the administration's refusal to declassify information Gesell says must be released for North to get a fair trial.
An interagency intelligence group in the Reagan administration has declined to declassify certain material in 300 prosecution exhibits Walsh wants to present at trial, which forced Walsh to seek dismissal of the two central charges.
Twelve charges remain.
Walsh said he is ``quite sure'' he can get an affidavit from Thornburgh and Gesell said he hopes to receive it by Thursday.
Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined to comment on whether Thornburgh would supply an affidavit, but a department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he assumed the attorney general probably will submit one.
Former U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes, newly on the prosecution witness list, in mid-1985 asked the NSC whether the staff was assisting the Contras and requested all information pertaining to contact between North and rebel leaders.
North prepared then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane's written response to the Democrat from Maryland, according to the two counts in the indictment against North that charge him with obstruction of Congress and making false statements.
The response to Barnes said that ``none of us has solicited funds, facilitated contacts for prospective potential donors, or otherwise organized or coordinated the military or paramilitary efforts of the resistance.''
Barnes at the time was chairman of the House subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs.
In congressional testimony on the Iran-Contra affair in 1987, North testified that ``I probably'' helped draft McFarlane's response to Barnes, but that ``I don't recall specifically, there were a number of these'' responses to congressional inquiries.
The letter to Barnes accounted for one of the misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress to which McFarlane pleaded guilty last March in the Iran-Contra affair.
Coors made the $65,000 contribution to the Contras after meeting with North in 1985, less than three months before the letter to Barnes from the NSC.
Coors has said he met in June 1985 with then-CIA Director William Casey, who referred Coors to North when Coors expressed an interest in giving money to the Contras at a time when U.S. military aid to them was banned by Congress.
At a meeting in Casey's office in the old executive office building next to the White House, the CIA director ``said Ollie North is the guy to see,'' Coors said in 1987 in congressional testimony on the Iran-Contra affair.
Coors then walked over to see North, who said the Contras needed a Maule aircraft and gave Coors the number of a Swiss bank account where he could send his contribution.
The account number was for Lake Resources Inc., part of the maze of companies which Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, who also are charged in the Iran-Contra case, used to funnel money to the Contras from the administration's arms sales to Iran as well as from a private fund-raising network.
Coors arranged for $65,000 to be sent to the Lake Resources account and then contacted North, saying he had made it clear he wanted to give humanitarian, non-military aid to the Contras.
Coors said North ``indicated that this plane would fit into that pattern.''
North denied in 1987 congressional testimony that he had solicited the funds, saying instead that Coors ``offered the money, and I told him where to send it.''
President Reagan, in his final report on the state of the economy, took credit today for ``an unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity'' and said a tax increase could undermine his legacy.
Reagan's eighth and final economic report says that the stagflation -- high inflation coupled with slow growth -- of the 1970s has given way during his tenure to the longest economic expansion since the 1960s and the lowest unemployment rate in 14 years.
``Today, it is as if the world were born anew,'' the president said in a nine-page introduction to this year's report, prepared by his Council of Economic Advisers.
``By reducing taxes and regulatory bureaucracy, we have unleashed the creative genius of ordinary Americans and ushered in an unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity,'' he said.
Although the report credited the administration with favorable economic developments, it sought to minimize the importance of the U.S. budget and trade deficits and it placed the blame for the worst year for bank and savings institution failures elsewhere.
Also, Democrats point out that Reagan's military buildup had the effect of running the economy on a wartime footing.
His deficit spending, they say, had the effect of creating prosperity now at the expense of future generations, who will have to pay the bill.
Beryl W. Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said the new report was aimed at placing the Reagan record in the context of post-World War II economic history.
He said Reagan was the first president since Harry Truman to leave office with both lower unemployment and inflation rates than when he took office.
Unemployment dropped from 7.6 percent in 1981 to 5.5 percent in 1988 and consumer price inflation from 10.3 percent to 4.4 percent.
After suffering a sharp recession in the beginning of Reagan's term, the country in October finished its sixth year of economic expansion, a record for peacetime, but short of the nearly nine-year expansion during the Vietnam War.
``The length, strength and resilience of this expansion are ample testimony to the wisdom of the policies that we have pursued,'' Reagan said.
The president's report said the budget deficit, as a percentage of the economy as measured by the gross national product, has shrunk from 5.2 percent in 1985 to 3.2 percent in 1988.
And, Reagan said that attempting to shrink the deficit with tax increases would sap economic growth.
``The large budget deficit that this nation faces is not a result of too few taxes, but too much spending. ... All that is required to reduce the deficit is to halt, or moderate, the increase in expenditures,'' Reagan said.
Sprinkel, in projections in the report, predicted continued GNP growth of 3.2 percent this year and at least that each year through 1994.
But, he said that was predicated on the assumption that taxes would not rise and that the Federal Reserve Board, which has sought growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent as a means of holding inflation in check, would keep interest rates low enough to foster growth.
The report said monetary policy so far has produced solid results, but it criticized the central bank for apparently basing its policy on short-term economic developments rather on long-term goals for the growth of the money supply.
The report also said, in effect, that the U.S. trade deficit, which hit a record $170 billion in 1987, was caused by the strength of the American economy.
Low inflation and high growth encouraged foreign investors to drive up the value of the dollar.
That in turn made foreign goods cheaper in the United States and American goods more expensive overseas.
It said the U.S. status as a net debtor has been greatly exaggerated in new accounts, partly because most measures underestimate the value of U.S. holdings abroad.
Foreigners hold only about 3.1 percent of U.S. assets, it said.
Banks and S & L failures, which in 1988 reached post-Depression records of 221 and 217, respectively, stem from improper incentives in the regulatory system, the report said.
It recommended reducing federal deposit insurance from its current level of $100,000 per account to encourage depositors and thus bank and S & L owners to be more cautious.
It said if reforms recommended in 1984 by a panel chaired by Vice President George Bush had been adopted, current bank and S & L problems ``would probably be much more manageable.''
Congress, ignoring one the recommendations, lowered the amount of investment money, or capital, S & L owners have to place behind public deposits, it said.
Hundreds of Vietnamese boat people drowned or otherwise died violent deaths last year after Thai authorities turned the refugees back to sea, a U.S. human rights group charged today.
The government rejected the report as ``prejudiced'' and said all refugee boats were allowed to land.
The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, in its 193-page report, detailed several alleged incidents of murder and brutality by Thai authorities.
It said Thai pirates ``ravaged, raped, and killed hundreds of Vietnamese boat people'' pushed out to sea.
The New York-based committee said Thailand continued to refuse refugees permission to land despite its January 1988 announcement that it renounced the policy.
In addition, about 330,000 Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees were exposed to lawlessness and cross-border warfare in camps along the Cambodian frontier last year, says the report entitled ``Refuge Denied.''
``Accounts by survivors received by the Lawyers Committee through their relatives in the U.S. reveal a pattern of murder, sexual abuse and robbery by Thai security forces authorized to `push off' new Vietnamese arrivals,'' the report declared.
A written statement from the Foreign Ministry described the report as ``unbalanced, prejudiced and at times sensational.''
It said all refugee boats were permitted to land and that arrivals were taken to a special camp in cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
Kasit Piromya, chief of the Department of International Organizations, disputed the committee's assertion that hundreds of Vietnamese drowned.
``Most of the fatalities that occurred resulted from capsizing of unseaworthy boats outside of Thai territorial waters,'' he said in the statement.
He said piracy against Vietnamese boat people declined from attacks on 77 percent of boats in 1981 to 10 percent in 1988.
The U.N. refugee agency also has reported a decrease in attacks.
Thailand has been praised for giving temporary asylum to hundreds of thousands of Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laotian refugees who have fled their homelands since the communist victories in Indochina in 1975.
But the Thais have been criticized for the treatment some local authorities give refugees, reluctance to act against pirates and policies that sometimes cause undue suffering to those seeking asylum.
In one case, the report says, 74 Vietnamese refugees who came via Cambodia in June 1988 were surrounded by Thai soldiers and towed back to sea in four small boats.
The soldiers abducted eight young girls, shot at one of the boats, tried to ram another and abandoned the survivors, the report says.
It says that in another case that month, only two boys survived of 61 Vietnamese who were towed to sea in small boats and fired on by soldiers with automatic rifles.
``Thai fishermen have interpreted the push-back policy and attitudes expressed by Thai officials and police as a mandate to rape, rob and murder Vietnamese boat people,'' the report said.
Officials should ``ensure respect for the basic human rights of the Vietnamese boat people,'' it said.
It accused Thailand of deterring refugees by creating poor living conditions at refugee camps.
The report was based on interviews and trips to Thailand by committee members last year.
James David Watkins, the former naval commander reportedly chosen by George Bush to head the Energy Department, is an authority on nuclear warfare who will put that expertise to work trying to clean up the nation's crumbling atomic weapons plants.
Watkins, whom CBS said has been picked to be Energy Secretary, will take over an agency charged with overseeing the multibillion-dollar renovation of the nation's aging and increasingly unsafe complex of plants that build nuclear warheads.
Watkins ended his 41-year Navy career in 1986 after a four-year stint as the chief of naval operations, the service's top officer.
But within a year, the former nuclear submarine commander had stepped into a new hot seat.
In October 1987, President Reagan picked Watkins to head the presidential commission that was supposed to tell Reagan what the nation should do about AIDS.
Watkins, used to command, jumped in with authority, guided the panel through exhaustive hearings and led it to a series of widely praised recommendations.
Watkins was born March 7, 1927, in Alhambra, Calif., near the Los Angeles harbor.
His mother was Louis Ward Watkins, who ran unsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination to California's Senate seat, one of the few women at the time who sought national office.
He later recalled that his mother used to take him and his brother down to nearby Navy ports to watch the big ships come and go.
She sometimes arranged to get the three of them aboard the ships, where they dined with officers and heard tales about life on the high seas.
It was those stories -- and the ships -- that helped convince Watkins he wanted a life in the Navy.
He entered the Naval Academy in 1945, just as World War II was winding down.
Following his graduation four years later, Watkins served aboard destroyers and submarines, earned a master's degree at the Naval Postgraduate School, and then made a decision that helped steer the course of his career.
Watkins went into nuclear submarines, where he came under the aegis of Adm.
Hyman Rickover, the father of the modern nuclear Navy and the man who played a key role in the careers of dozens of Navy leaders in the post-World War II era.
After completing the nuclear reactor engineering course at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory, Watkins took command of the nuclear-powered attack sub Snook.
Watkins steered the Snook into the harbor at Yokosuka, Japan, the first visit of a nuclear-powered ship to the only nation which has been the target of nuclear attack.
More than 5,000 demonstrators greeted the ship.
Watkins rose within the Navy's ranks and became commander of the Pacific Fleet, based in Honolulu.
He was in that post in March 1982 when Reagan picked him as chief of naval operations.
In that post, Watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup, from 450 to nearly 600 ships, that was at the heart of Reagan's defense budget during the president's first term.
Watkins and his wife of 38 years, Sheila Jo, have raised six children.
Shining Path rebels killed 11 policemen in a cocaine-producing jungle valley, and Lima police arrested 200 students in a protest instigated by the Maoist guerrilla group, authorities said.
The two weekend ambushes by the Shining Path in the Huallaga Valley, where about 60 percent of the world's coca crop is grown, also wounded 11 people, the government paper La Cronica reported Tuesday.
The deaths brought the insurgency toll since Saturday to 28 killed.
In Lima, dozens of heavily armed riot police swept onto the San Marcos University campus on Tuesday, police said, arresting 200 students who were blocking nearby streets with rocks and bonfires and exploding dynamite charges.
Police reported no injuries in the protest, one of dozens at San Marcos over the past year.
Witnesses said the disturbance was sparked by recent austerity measures, but officials said Shining Path supporters were behind the campus violence.
The weekend deaths come amid a recent spurt of violence in the Shining Path insurgency, which has claimed 12,000 victims since fighting began in 1980.
La Cronica said separate guerrillas columns hiding in the dense jungle opened fire on passing patrol vehicles with automatic weapons and hand grenades.
Seven policemen were slain on a jungle road 20 miles northwest of Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima, and four policemen died in an ambush near Polvora, 100 miles north of Tingo Maria, La Cronica said.
There were no reports of rebel casualties or word on whether police were able to return the gunfire.
Officials said the region has become a no-man's land overrun by drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas who provide the traffickers protection in exchange for funds to buy weapons.
Peruvian coca is usually processed into a semi-refined state and smuggled into Colombia, where it is turned into pure cocaine for sale in U.S. and European markets, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
The Huallaga Valley, Ayacucho and Apurimac are among eight states currently under states of emergency, giving the military broad policing and governing powers to counter the rebels.
A relative of a Mafia informant whose testimony has helped put hundreds of people behind bars has been shot to death in an apparent underworld vendetta, police said.
Sebastino Lombardo, 41, was gunned down Tuesday as he was driving home on the outskirts of Palermo.
It was not immediately known how many people were involved in the attack.
Lombardo was thebrother-in-law of Salvatore ``Totuccio'' Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informant whose testimony helped convict 338 defendants in the Mafia trial that ended in December 1987 and was Italy's largest ever.
One of Contorno's brothers, Giuseppe, was murdered in Sicily last September.
The shooting came a month after Contorno testified before Italian magistrates, who questioned him in the United States to prepare another mass Mafia trial.
Police blamed the Mafia for both slayings.
One investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was not clear if the Mafia targeted Contorno's relatives out of pure revenge or because they were suspected of being his own informers.
Last month, Italy's state television broadcast an interview with Contorno that was conducted at an undisclosed location in the United States.
In the interview, Contorno assessed the current state of the Mafia and spoke of its connections with judges and politicians.
After Tomasso Buscetta, Contorno is considered the state's star witness against the Sicilian Mafia.
As part of a deal for helping the Americans in the ``Pizza Connection'' heroin investigation, the 42-year-Contorno receives $1,300 a month and is moved from location to location under the U.S. government's witness protection program.
George Bush's Cabinet is emerging as nearly all male, all Republican establishment, but women and conservatives are holding their fire.
Bush's honeymoon period is quite a contrast to eight years ago when conservatives voiced outrage over several of Ronald Reagan's Cabinet choices.
The Reagan transition was marked by regular denunciations by conservatives of such Cabinet choices as Donald T. Regan for treasury secretary and Malcolm Baldrige for commerce secretary.
No such outcry has greeted the Bush Cabinet although most of the choices are no more acceptable to conservatives.
The only Bush Cabinet appointee to rank as a conservative hero is former Rep. Jack Kemp, the choice to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Craig Shirley, a conservative consultant who backed Bush for the GOP presidential nomination, said there is a mixed response to the emerging administration.
``Some are very delighted because Bush struck conservative themes during the campaign and he hasn't changed on any of those,'' he said.
``Others are taking more of a wait-and-see attitude and then there are the historical Bush-bashers.''
One of the longtime Bush bashers is Richard Viguerie, a conservative fund-raiser, who was an early and outspoken critic of Reagan Cabinet choices.
``The consensus (among conservatives) is, this is not the time, let's wait,'' said Viguerie.
``There is nothing to be gained by going out there and pounding the table now.''
Viguerie was less restrained than many of his conservative allies and he described the Bush appointments as ``very disillusioning, discouraging and disappointing.''
Throughout his campaign and since winning the presidency, Bush has emphasized his desire to reach out and bring into government people ``who are too often overlooked.''
If by that he meant women, so far, he has fallen short.
``I keep being told, give it time,'' said Nancy Thompson, a Republican consultant who was a Bush delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention.
``I've got my fingers crossed.''
Thompson and Susan McLane, a Republican state senator in New Hampshire, chose to praise the women Bush has chosen rather than bemoan those left out.
Both cited the selection of Elizabeth Dole to head the Labor Department and Carla Hills to be trade representative as encouraging choices.
But McLane conceded that women appear still to be at a stage where they must be satisfied with one or two high-visibility jobs in an administration.
``I think we are still at that age,'' she said.
As for the president-elect's attitude toward appointing women, she said, ``I don't think George Bush has thought about it that much and he hasn't thought about it as something important.''
``There are only a very few of those top, top spots,'' said Thompson.
``And to have two -- one and a half, if you will (Hills would have Cabinet status but not run a full department) that are that visible, that's good.''
Thompson said she expected to see far more women in the next round of appointments.
``I'm waiting for this second cut.
I believe that's where we're going to find some names.''
Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, a strong Bush supporter from the earliest stages of the presidential campaign, was on many lists of potential Cabinet appointees.
``My name was being thrown around a lot, not necessarily to my benefit,'' she said.
``The fact is he never asked me to serve in his Cabinet and I don't know if I would have or could have. ... I think there was an assumption I was talking to him every day and it just wasn't so.''
Martin, who denied any personal disappointment, said, ``I know he has asked again and again for the group around him to give him the names of more women, of more Hispanics or more blacks.''
``I believe we're going to see a lot of women,'' she added.
``And if we don't, the shoe drops.''
The man who would be education president says he'll push certain public school reforms and provide whatever aid he can in ``tough budgetary times'' to districts trying to improve their schools.
``I do want to help,'' President-elect Bush told educators Tuesday at a White House workshop on experiments that give parents wide freedom to select their children's public schools.
``I do intend to provide every feasible assistance to states, to districts interested in further experimentation with choice plans and other valuable reforms,'' Bush said.
``I will ask the Department of Education to monitor and focus continued attention on the need for future progress, and I'll be a spokesman and advocate for further public school improvements.''
Bush said he is particularly enthusiastic about having parents and students being able to choose their public schools, calling the prevailing system of assigned schools a trap and their students ``captive clients.''
``It's a system that can perpetuate mediocrity,'' he said.
``Poor schools have no incentives to improve.''
Supporters of choosing schools say it makes schools more competitive and responsive, improves morale and attendance, reduces disciplinary problems and dropouts, and improves learning among students.
President Reagan, addressing the workshop earlier in the day, cited the examples of ``a Harlem school district in which scores have risen dramatically because parents are now permitted to choose which school to send their children to'' and a Minnesota program ``that is fostering unprecedented competition among public schools to make them more attractive to parents and students.''
Referring to the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 that integrated public schools, Bush said it is now time to focus on what goes on inside those doors.
``Quality education has become a central civil rights question of our time,'' he said.
``And too often today it is our disadvantaged children who are most likely to be burdened by inadequate public education.''
Bush said that for choice to work, teachers and principals need greater autonomy and authority, while parents need better publicized, more reliable performance evaluations of schools.
The heads of the nation's two teacher unions both attended the workshop and said they were encouraged by the emphasis on strengthening public schools, as opposed to giving needy parents public money to send their kids to private schools -- a recurring Reagan administration theme.
``I didn't hear anything about vouchers or tuition tax credits and those would be the red flags for us,'' said Mary Futrell, president of the National Education Association.
``To the extent you increase public school choice, you decrease pressure for vouchers and tuition tax credits,'' added Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers.
A vast majority of Americans support programs to help the chronically poor, according to a survey released today by a civil rights group.
The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund also said it found further erosion in opposition to busing to achieve school integration.
``The survey demonstrates that the public is primed for presidential action and leadership on race relations issues,'' said Elaine Jones, deputy director-counsel of the fund.
The survey found that 93 percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored special school programs beginning at age 8 to motivate poor youngsters to stay in school and not drop out.
Ninety percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored federal youth corps camps where poor young people could learn to read and write and attain other skills.
Similar majorities supported business incentives to provide jobs in poor neighborhoods.
Among blacks, 79 percent said the best long-term way to combat crime was not ``to spend large sums of money sending criminals to prison and keeping them there a long time'' but to ``spend the same money attacking the causes of crime, such as reducing poverty, keeping young people in school and motivating young people to succeed rather than become criminals.''
Among whites, 81 percent agreed.
The civil rights group said the poll was taken June 3 through Sept. 12 by Louis Harris and Associates and based on interviews with more than 3,000 people.
The report was unclear as to the margin of error.
According to the survey, 57 percent of whites remained opposed to busing children to achieve school integration but 67 percent of blacks remained in favor of it.
Among all Americans, it was favored by 54 percent.
Until two years ago, opposition among all Americans had remained a consistent 78 percent for three decades.
The survey was accompanied by a separate study documenting conditions among the black poor.
Eighty-six percent of single mothers surveyed received no funds from their families or the government to pay for child care.
Just 11 percent said they received federal or state housing subsidies.
Sixteen percent reported having private health insurance, compared with 60 percent among all Americans.
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. is a separate and distinct organization from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Founded in 1940s, the New York-based group has played a major role in many of the battles or the civil rights era.
Women and minorities who worked for a major Chicago bank from 1973 to 1988 will share a record $14 million in back pay the bank agreed to pay in settling a race and sex bias case dating to 1977.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank and the Labor Department announced the settlement Tuesday, ending an 11-year legal battle in which an administrative law judge twice ruled against the institution.
A Chicago group that intervened on behalf of some bank workers estimated that about 5,000 current and former Harris employees are eligible for a share of the settlement.
Harris said it would put the money in an escrow account in another bank.
The government is responsible for finding the workers and determining how much back pay to award them.
The bank said it was not admitting to any wrongdoing but was settling the case to avoid ``more legal and statistical wrangling.''
Under the agreement, Harris Trust must revise its affirmative action policies, set up training programs for women and minorities seeking promotions to professional and managerial posts, and tell the department periodically over the next three years how well it is complying with the agreement and anti-discrimination laws.
The agreement did not set any quotas or goals for the bank to meet.
The Labor Department in 1977 charged that Harris Trust was discriminating by promoting white men at a higher rate than women and minorities with comparable skills and was paying the white men more for comparable work.
Four years later, a Labor Department administrative law judge ruled that Harris Trust had discriminated against women and minorities in a number of areas.
The judge awarded $12.2 million in back pay.
But then-Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan set aside the decision, saying the bank wrongly had been denied an opportunity to present statistical studies in its defense.
The case was reheard and in 1986 the judge again ruled the bank was liable for back pay to women and minority employees on its payroll from 1974 to Dec. 22, 1986, unless it could prove it ceased the discriminatory practices before that date.
The settlement announced Tuesday expanded that period to cover women and minorities in the bank's employ at any time from May 1973 to December 1988.
The Labor Department's solicitor, George R. Salem, said the settlement ``represents a major step forward, not only for the present and former employees of the Harris bank who will benefit from it but also for all women and minority group workers in the American labor force.''
But B. Kenneth West, chairman and chief executive officer of Harris Trust, said that ending the matter was ``a pure business decision'' made ``not because we believe we are guilty but because the administrative process for a defendant is lengthy, time-consuming, costly and frustrating.''
``The time has come to put this matter behind us,'' he said.
Harris Trust, with assets of $11.7 billion, reported employing 3,967 workers as of Dec. 28, 1988.
Of them, 59.8 percent were women and 33.7 percent minorities, with some overlap.
West, in the bank's statement, said Harris Trust expected to report within weeks record earnings for 1988 and would charge the ``majority'' of the settlement expenses to its 1988 operations.
He was not more specific.
Salem said $14 million was the largest back pay award ever obtained by the department in a case involving alleged sex or race discrimination.
The previous record was $10 million, he said.
Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich credits recent Soviet moves toward artistic freedom for his plan to present the world premiere of a long-suppressed musical satire written by the late composer Dmitri Shostakovich to ridicule the Stalinist regime.
The unpublished, 15-minute theatrical piece entitled ``Rayok,'' Russian for ``Little Eden,'' will be performed for the first time Thursday night in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, with Rostropovich at the piano leading a cast of four bass singers and a small mixed chorus.
Three additional performances will be given at the Kennedy Center through Tuesday, and Shostakovich's son, Maxim, a conductor who defected to the United States in 1981, was expected to be in the audience for a Sunday afternoon performance in New York's Carnegie Hall.
Rostropovich, the Soviet-born music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, apparently acquired a copy of the score and libretto for ``Rayok'' only recently.
At a news conference Tuesday, he refused to say how or exactly when it fell into his hands.
``There are a lot of counterfeits around,'' he said, ``but I'm willing to put my life on the line that this is Shostakovich's music.''
He said Shostakovich secretly wrote ``Rayok'' in 1960 to express his contempt for Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who had died seven years earlier, and two senior Kremlin bureaucrats who had led a harsh ideological crackdown on Soviet composers, writers and artists in the late 1940s.
Rostropovich, a close friend of Shostakovich for more than 20 years, said that until recently it would have meant imprisonment or the death penalty to perform ``Rayok'' in the Soviet Union.
But under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he said, ``now you can do this even in the Soviet Union.''
Rostropovich said he knows of no plans for a Soviet performance of the work, although he said the late composer's family is negotiating to have it published.
He said he has no fears his performances of the long-hidden piece might jeopardize the safety of the Shostakovich family, as it might have in the recent past.
``If I thought this would make it difficult for the family, I wouldn't do it,'' he said.
Rostropovich said the ability to present ``Rayok'' without fear of repercussions is another sign that ``now the Soviet Union has truly changed and this is a happy time.''
He said Gorbachev's repudiation of the excesses of the Stalin era vindicates Shostakovich's criticism.
``Finally the arts are being turned over to people who understand them,'' Rostropovich said.
``No one in the Politburo is being a musical teacher to artists.''
The Shostakovich work is a scathing put-down of Stalin and of Dmitri T. Shepilov and Andrei A. Zhdanov, the high-level officials of the Soviet Communist Party who led the cultural purge that began in 1947.
According to Rostropovich, the musical satire is based on speeches given at a special meeting of the party's Central Committee in 1948, where prominent Soviet composers -- including Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev -- were denounced for ``formalistic tendencies'' and directed to write music of ``realism'' for the masses.
Shostakovich privately held the musical bureaucrats in contempt as crude and ignorant.
He publicly confessed he was guilty of their charges and was kicked out of the Moscow Conservatory.
Rostropovich himself fled his homeland in 1974, the year before Shostakovich died in Moscow, and was stripped of his Soviet citizenship in 1978, the same year he was hired by the National Symphony.
Although heartened by Gorbachev's reform policies, Rostropovich said he remains an official non-person in the Soviet Union and has no plans to return.
The commission trying to find a way to eliminate the huge federal budget deficit has the go-ahead from President-elect Bush to start putting its proposals in writing.
Bush sent word to the National Economic Commission that he would like to have the group's recommendations in hand by March 1.
Bush's decision was being hailed by commission members as a sign that the president-elect planned to use the 14-member panel's work in his own budget negotiations with Congress.
The commission, which includes such leaders as Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and AFL-CIO Chairman Lane Kirkland, was created by Congress with the hope that it could come up with a deficit-reduction package acceptable to the new administration and Congress.
Commission co-chairman Drew Lewis said the panel would be able to meet the deadline, and many panelists expressed pleasure that Bush had decided not to postpone the commission's report until Sept. 1, which he had the option of doing.
Some had feared that Bush, who was critical of the panel during the presidential election, might decide to delay the report in an effort to play down any recommendations from the panel.
Lewis said he was told of the reporting decision on Tuesday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will retain that position in the Bush administration.
Lewis said Brady told him to prepare recommendations over the next seven weeks unless he hears otherwise from Bush once he takes office on Jan. 20.
The commission met Tuesday to review the outlook for the economy.
The assumptions the panel decides to use for such things as economic growth, inflation, unemployment and interest rates will have a big effect on how much in deficit reductions it will need to recommend to eliminate the budget deficit in coming years.
Bush said during the presidential campaign that the commission was little more than a stalking horse for tax increases, which Bush has vowed to oppose.
Since winning election, however, Bush has insisted he is serious about reducing the federal deficit, partly to calm fears of foreign investors and prevent a run on the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets.
The advisory panel, which is headed by Lewis, a Republican, and by Democrat Robert Strauss, has scheduled a string of hearings this month and next to craft a plan.
Originally, those hearings were to be held in secret, but a group of news organizations won a court battle last week that forced the sessions to be opened to the public.
Lewis, former transportation secretary in the Reagan administration and now chairman of Union Pacific, said Tuesday it was possible that the commission might be forced to issue a majority and a minority report because differences among panel members could prove too wide to bridge.
He said there was also a possibility that even after the commission issues its report, it may be called back into session by the administration if a deadlock develops with Congress over the budget.
``If the president-elect and Congress can't solve this problem, then we probably would be brought back into action,'' Lewis said.
The meeting Tuesday was the first one attended by Bush's two appointees to the panel, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., and former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio.
The chances of all of an airliner's engines going out may be 10 million to one, but with millions of flights each year, it still happens.
At least four U.S.-built jetliners, in addition to the Boeing 737 that crashed Sunday in England killing 44 people, have experienced the loss of all their engines in flight, according to government records:
--Last May, an El Salvadoran Taca Airlines 737 lost both engines while descending in a thunderstorm near New Orleans but managed to land safely on a levee.
--In August 1987, another 737 belonging to a European regional airline lost power in a snowstorm over Greece, but pilots restarted the engines.
--In May 1983, an Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-1011 en route from Miami to the Bahamas lost all three of its engines, but pilots managed to restart one and land safely back in Miami.
Investigators concluded that maintenance workers neglected to check that critical oil seals were in place.
--In April 1977, a Southern Airways DC9 lost power in its two engines in a hailstorm and crash-landed in New Hope, Ga., killing 62 people and injuring 23 others.
The four incidents occurred over a period when U.S. airliners were logging between 6 million and 7 million flights a year.
A British investigator said there was a one in 10 million chance of both of a two-engine airliner's engines failing on the same flight.
The two incidents involving 737s powered by CFM56 engines like those on the British flight led the Federal Aviation Administration to issue air worthiness directives ordering pilots to take special procedures during landings in stormy weather.
FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the directives would not have applied to the British flight, however, because it was in clear weather and at a high altitude when the first engine failed.
Although some officials at the scene in England initially said pilot error was not to blame, investigators said Tuesday they were looking into the possibility that the pilot erroneously shut down his remaining good engine instead of the one that caught fire in the air.
National Transportation Safety Board records show 92 double engine failures in U.S. airplanes since 1962, but the vast majority were in small planes that ran out of gas.
When both engines on a plane go out, investigators normally would look at the performance of the pilot, particularly actions taken after one engine fails, along with the engines themselves, the fuel and electrical systems, and the possibility of sabotage or maintenance failure, among other possible causes.
Planes with the CFM56 engines such as those used on the 737 have been involved in 13 air accidents or incidents, including four that were attributed to engine trouble, according to safety board records.
Two days before the British Midland crash, a federal judge in Cincinnati ordered the unsealing of a four-month-old lawsuit that alleges that components in engines including the CFM56s used in the new Boeing 737 that crashed in England were inadequately tested at a General Electric plant in Seattle, Wash., and that the company falsified test reports on military engines.
GE has denied inadequate testing of any CFM56s, and FAA spokesman Farrar said a timer assembly for the engines involved in the suit could not have caused the British crash.
He said its failure would only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not fire.
Farrar said no government investigation of engine testing is planned before investigators determine the cause of the crash.
``Any engine has to meet very rigid requirements as to performance and construction,'' said Farrar.
``There is no reason to believe the GE engines had any fatal flaw.''
The engines were thoroughly tested in France, at the GE plant in the United States and again after they were installed in the plane in Seattle, said General Electric spokesman William Shumann.
He said about 1,000 of the engines are in use.
But James Helmer, lawyer for former GE Seattle plant manager Anthony DiVincenzo, who filed the suit, said the timer part and possibly other GE-built components of the CFM56 were inadequately tested.
He said DiVincenzo secretly filed his suit after he exposed inadequate testing to GE officials and was demoted and reassigned to a plant in Cincinnati.
``The government should have been investigating this engine six months ago, not after 44 people are killed,'' Helmer said in a telephone interview.
Helmer said a team of whistleblower lawyers would conduct an investigation of engine manufacturing, including visits to the GE plant in Seattle, an examination of documents on engine tests and depositions from plant workers and officials.
The CFM56 engines on the British plane were manufactured in France with both U.S. and French components under an agreement between GE and the French company SNECMA.
The CFM56s used on 737s have been in service for about five years.
Wilburt Siegel, the 73-year-old cancer victim jailed in a dispute over a sewer hook-up, was freed Thursday after a state prison and a county jail both refused to accept him as a prisoner.
Siegel spent Wednesday night in the Lieber Correctional Institution in Ridgeville.
But he was released after state officials decided they lacked authority to imprison an inmate for civil contempt of court.
Siegel was then sent back to Charleston County, but Sheriff Al Cannon said the county jail couldn't house him because it is overcrowded.
He also said the jail didn't have the medical facilities to treat Siegel, who suffers from rectal cancer.
Charleston attorney Gedney Howe then asked for a hearing before Circuit Judge William Howell, who found Siegel in contempt last November.
``Al Cannon and I came to the same conclusion if he couldn't go to Lieber, he sure couldn't go to the county jail,'' Howe said.
Before the hearing, Howe said he and the judge discussed options in the case and said Howell said a motion to appeal the contempt order could be considered.
``I appealed the judge's opinion which will postpone him (Siegel) going back to jail,'' Howe said.
He said appeals to the state Supreme Court can take some time and ``hopefully he'll be a free man for at least several months.''
``Judge Howell today looked at a difficult problem and found a way out that was satisfactory to everybody and was legally correct,'' Howe said.
``We're so weary and thankful and we're just going to go to bed,'' Siegel's wife Hattie said later from the couple's home.
``It's been a rough day.''
The contempt order stems from Siegels' refusal to obey an earlier 1986 court order that he connect his James Island home to a sewer line.
The Siegels have had a decade-long dispute with the James Island Public Service District over connecting the sewer.
They say the tap-in point is too far from their septic tank and would cost them an additional $2,000 and cause them to destroy several large pine trees in order to make the connection.
Francis X. Archibald, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said the issue arose as to whether Lieber should house the prisoner after Siegel arrived at the prison Wednesday.
``They referred it to the department's legal advisor in Columbia who researched the matter and he said we lacked the authority'' to house a prisoner jailed for civil contempt, Archibald said.
He said the decision was based on an attorney general's opinion of some years back.
The Siegel case was later the topic of a discussion between Corrections Department legal advisor Larry Batson and state Attorney General Travis Medlock and Medlock concurred in the decision, Archibald said.
On Wednesday, Cannon escorted Siegel from the modest James Island house, which was draped with an American flag and where yellow ribbons were tied around five large pine trees.
Siegel said he was going to prison for his principles and that he had been treated unfairly compared to other residents in the area who had sewer lines closer to their homes or had not been forced to hook onto the sewer.
An enraged Nikita Khrushchev instructed Soviet ships to ignore President Kennedy's naval blockade during the Cuban missile crisis, but the order was reversed just hours before an inevitable confrontation, according to a new book.
James G. Blight and David A. Welch of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government say that ``if this order had held, war between the superpowers would probably have commenced at sea, shortly after 10 o'clock on Wednesday morning, Oct. 24, 1962, several hundred miles off the coast of Cuba.''
Anastas Mikoyan, then Soviet first deputy premier, was the catalyst for the reversal of Khrushchev's order, according to the authors.
Mikoyan ``preempted Khrushchev's order to run the blockade and ordered Soviet ships to stop just short of the quarantine line,'' they say.
But Blight and Welch said at a news conference Wednesday that it remains unclear whether Mikoyan reversed or circumvented the decision on his own or convinced Khrushchev of its perils.
Welch said the order was reversed just hours before Soviet ships reached U.S. forces.
The book, ``On the Brink: Americans and Soviets Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis,'' is based largely on two 1987 conferences sponsored by Harvard -- one that featured top Kennedy advisers and U.S. scholars and a second in which three Soviets joined the Americans.
The book will serve as a backdrop for a third conference scheduled for Jan. 27-29 in Moscow featuring, for the first time, Soviet, American and Cuban officials who participated in the crisis, which was triggered when Soviet troops began installing missiles in Cuba capable of reaching the United States.
Secret correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev concerning the missile crisis is expected to be released at the conference, according to Harvard officials.
The book said Khrushchev's order to ignore the blockade was disclosed in a largely unknown work by dissident Soviet historian Roy Medvedev.
The Harvard authors said much of the information has been confirmed independently by Mikoyan's son, Sergo, who was an aide to his father during the crisis.
The authors also conclude that the missiles in Cuba probably did not have warheads.
Their theory that the warheads were blocked by the quarantine is at odds with a recent disclosure by Aleksander Alekseev, the former ambassador to Cuba, who said in a recent Soviet magazine that 42 medium-range missiles were fully operational.
But the authors suggested that Alekseev, along with others in the Soviet diplomatic corps, were not receiving accurate information from Moscow about the missiles.
Skiers and operators of fashionable resorts in the Alps and Dolomites are facing a severe dry spell that has left northern Italy snowless and caused sharp losses to the multimillion-dollar ski industry.
But in the long term, the dryness may be most damaging to farmers in the plains.
Their national association claimed this week that this year's harvests of wheat and barley are being jeopardized by the lack of moisture.
It also said an expected lowering in river levels may hurt rice farming in the Po valley this spring.
``If it does not snow, and a lot, within this month we will have no water to submerge 150,000 hectares (370,500 acres) of rice,'' said Bruno Pusterla, a top official of the Italian Agricultural Confederation.
``In the meantime drought is already causing damage to seedlings.''
The latest snowfall on the Italian side of the Alps date back to early December, when an average of eight inches of fresh snow elated owners of hotels and ski lifts.
Not a single drop of rain or a flake of snow has since been spotted in northern Italy.
Dozens of tourists upset by the lack of snow and poor accommodations protested in Salice d'Ulzio, near the French border, forcing local authorities to negotiate repayment of a share of their pre-paid vacations.
Unusually high temperatures prevented the use of snowmakers, considered a good defense in case of late winter snowfalls in resorts such as Sestriere, Courmayeur, Bormio, Madonna di Campiglio and Selva Val Gardena.
Resorts had spent several million dollars to install batteries of snow-making equipment on Alpine slopes.
Snow bulletins issued weekly by tourist offices list an increasing number of closed ski lifts and cable cars.
The highest Alpine ski tracks -- above 6,000 feet -- report no more than 12 to 16 inches.
The few resorts with favorable ski conditions because of their shady positions were invaded by thousands of Chrismas holiday skiers -- quickly spoiling their slopes.
The unusual high pressure over northern Italy also touched off several consecutive days of thick fog in the plains, which closed airports, hampered road traffic and caused pile-ups on highways.
``We can only hope that snow comes soon and plentifully, to salvage a tourist season already compromised,'' says Caterina Prossliner, who runs a luxury hotel in Val Badia, near the Austrian border.
Some international cross-country races scheduled in northern Italy in mid-January were canceled for lack of snow while World Cup races early in December were held with some difficulty on artificial snow.
Several of the early races of the competition France, Austria and Switzerland were rescheduled last month.
However, the three neighboring Alpine countries have had some recent snowfalls of 14 to 40 inches.
Some members of the environmentalist Green Party claim a steady rise in winter temperatures and the frequent dry spells are the result of the ``greenhouse effect'', or climactic warming, resulting from humankind's burning of fossil fuels.
However, Franca Chlistovsky, who heads the Brera metereologic institute in Milan, said this winter's dry spell was not exceptional and several worse years have been registered since 1950.
``People have a slippery memory.
Certainly winter has begun later than usual in some recent years, but it lasted longer,'' she explained.
``Desire Under the Elms,'' a new opera based on Eugene O'Neill's play of the same name, is blessed with a story perfect for opera -- full of rivalry, greed, sex and violence.
Soprano Judy Kaye, who won a Tony on Broadway last year, stars in the New York Opera Repertory Theater production, and is splendid in the pivotal role of Abbie.
But the music composed by Edward Thomas doesn't have all the power it needs.
The opera had its first staged presentation Wednesday at the City Center.
Operas these days are melodic, minimalist or have a jagged vocal line that doesn't sound like a melody to most listeners.
``Desire Under the Elms'' is of the latter kind.
That's fine and this opera sounds good much of the time.
But in arias expressing emotion for instance, it often sounds bland.
A lullaby is a departure from the rest of the music.
But when a very dramatic moment comes, that music should also be a departure, hitting some heights.
In ``Desire Under the Elms,'' the drama is principally carried by the situation and the words being sung.
Abbie marries elderly Ephraim Cabot (bass Nicholas Solomon), seduces his son Eben (tenor James Schwisow) and has a baby.
Abbie, Ephraim and Eben each want total ownership of the farm on which they live.
So the stew of sex, love and deception is further stirred by mistrust of love based on what any one might do to get the farm.
The orchestral scoring isn't heavy so most of the words could be understood.
The men's voices were good but not big, an appraisal which extends to Robert Paul Heimann and William Livingston, as two older sons who leave home before Abbie arrives.
Miss Kaye's voice most nearly filled the house.
The New York Opera Repertory Theater was founded in 1977 by Leigh Gibbs Gore, who conducted the opera.
It is dedicated to creation and performance of opera and new music theater.
Composer Thomas is a native of Chisholm, Minn.
Joe Masteroff, who wrote the book for Broadway's ``She Loves Me'' and ``Cabaret,'' is making his debut as a librettist.
``Desire Under the Elms'' was done in a workshop at the O'Neill Theater Center's National Music Theater Conference, in its first year, 1978.
It also has had concert performances.
The set for this first staged presentation was a cutaway two-story house by Michael Anania.
Gregg Barnes designed costumes and David Gately directed.
It will be performed again on Friday and Sunday.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he no longer can rule out the possibility charges may be brought against West Germany companies reported to have helped Libya build a suspected chemical weapons factory.
West German officials have for weeks denied discovering any evidence supporting U.S. charges that West German firms helped build the plant in Rabta, 40 miles south of Tripoli.
But several West German news reports on Wednesday said West Germany companies played a major role in supplying equipment for and assisting in the construction of the plant, which Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi contends is not a chemical weapons but a pharmaceutical plant.
Kohl told a news conference that a team of West German experts left for Washington Wednesday to discuss the U.S. allegations in more detail.
Asked about the new accusations that West German companies were involved in the Rabta plant, he said: ``All evidence will be investigated thoroughly.
I cannot exclude that there may be some evidence that could stand up in court.''
But the West German leader emphasized that his government must have such evidence ` before action is taken.
``The government cannot ground its action on speculation,'' Kohl said.
Federal officials already have confirmed that a criminal investigation has begun against a now-defunct Frankfurt firm, I.B.I. Engineering, and that investigators had seized company documents.
But they told The Associated Press that no proof had been yet found that West German companies were involved in the Libyan plant.
However, in its evening news report Wednesday, the ARD television network showed what it said were documents seized by customs officials that allegedly show transactions between the Imhausen-Chemie company and Libya.
The names of I.B.I. and Imhausen could be read on some of the documents, but the exact nature of the papers was not clear.
Stern magazine reported in today's editions that I.B.I. was deeply involved in the Libyan plant along with Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical material company.
Imhausen-Chemie and Pen Tsao were cleared in an initial audit last week.
All three companies have been named by U.S. officials in their accusations - delivered privately to Bonn authorities -- that West German firms aided Libya in building the plant.
A Finance Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed Wednesday that I.B.I. was now under investigation.
He said the West German Customs Service, which is conducting the investigation, had seized I.B.I. documents as part of the probe.
Stern magazine said the documents had been in the possession of Harry B. Meyer of Frankfurt, which it identified as a tax adviser to I.B.I. owner Ihsan Barbouti, an Iraqi national.
``The investigators are looking into whether I.B.I. shipped goods to Libya and whether they required an export permit,'' said the official.
He said a Belgian transport company, Crosslink of Antwerp, was being probed by Belgian officials and that Bonn had asked authorities in the neighboring country to assist in the I.B.I. investigation.
Stern said many of I.B.I.'s deliveries were carried out by an unidentified shipper in Antwerp.
It named no sources in its report, but said the material was based on official documents and first-person reports.
The Hamburg-based magazine claimed I.B.I. ``to a large extent organized the total project in the Libyan desert.''
Stern said federal authorities have confiscated documents showing that I.B.I., Imhausen-Chemie and Pen Tsao were involved in the Libyan project.
It said Imhausen delivered ``everything that is needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I. The magazine alleged that some of the materials were shipped by Pen Tsao under bills of lading to Hong Kong, but actually delivered to Libya.
Libya claims its new plant will produce pharmaceuticals, not poison gas or other biological weapons.
The United States claims it has evidence to the contrary, and those claims have been supported by Canada, The Netherlands and Britain, which says it has independent confirmation.
The U.S. preoccupation with the Rabta plant led Gadhafi to accuse the United States of planning an air strike to knock it out.
On Jan. 4, two U.S. F-14 jet fighters shot down two Libyan warplanes over the Mediterranean about 600 miles from the plant.
Washington claimed the downings were provoked by aggressive and threatening actions by armed Libyan aircraft, while Libya said its jets were unarmed and on a reconaissance flight over international waters.
South Carolina is home to wealthy cotton plantations, stately antebellum mansions and a growing share of America's toxic wastes.
Now, with a 10-year-old waste landfill's license up for renewal, a debate is looming over the state's role as the nation's ``septic tank.''
``We have been taken advantage of,'' said state Rep. Harry Hallman, who resigned in November as chairman of the Department of Health and Environmental Control to take a seat in the House of Representatives.
He's pushing legislation that would tighten state control of waste disposal.
The GSX Chemical Services Inc. landfill in Sumter County is one of two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast -- the other is in Alabama -- and is the tomb for a half-million tons of chemicals.
South Carolina is also home to two hazardous-waste incinerators and one for infectious waste; the Barnwell low-level nuclear waste landfill, and the troubled Savannah River Plant that produces nuclear bomb fuel.
``It all plays in.
The reason GSX has become an issue is not because it is the only issue, but because it's a symbolic issue,'' said Democratic state Sen. Phil Leventis, a long-time critic of the landfill.
Some 130,000 tons of chemical garbage will be buried at GSX this year, about 70 percent from industries in more than 30 other states and Puerto Rico.
Two incinerators, in Roebuck and Rock Hill, can accept a total of 58,920 tons a year of hazardous waste; 75 percent is from other states.
A third can take 36,500 tons of infectious waste, which comes from 10 states and Canada.
The Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc. low-level radioactive waste landfill at Barnwell -- the only one in operation in the nation -- took 900,000 cubic feet of contaminated clothing, tools and other debris in 1988 and expects the same this year.
The state produces 85,000 tons of hazardous waste a year, according to the health department.
It has plenty of room for its neighbors' garbage.
``It seems we're a patsy for somebody, doesn't it?
It seems that the federal government has found a place that doesn't resist,'' said Shelly Green of Sumter, a retired hotel manager and Air Force major.
``It just seems that we're getting more than our share.
``I feel that at some point in time, that place will be a real problem to us, and that we shouldn't be required to take other states' waste.''
The 279-acre GSX landfill opened in 1978.
Its bottom rests 10 feet above an aquifer and its lip is 400 yards from Lake Marion, one of the Santee Cooper lakes created in World War II to provide hydroelectric power to underdeveloped areas and Charleston's defense-related industries.
State and company officials say the hard claystone from which the landfill is carved makes it a natural location.
But siting standards for hazardous waste landfills are only now being drafted and are not expected before the end of 1989.
DHEC has decided not to wait for the standards to make a decision on the landfill's permit, and officials say they can be applied retroactively.
GSX encases its waste in two layers of clay 3 feet and 5 feet thick, separated by two hard plastic liners and a leak detection system.
The waste is tested on arrival to ensure that it's not flammable, radioactive, explosive or laced with dioxin, then it is mixed with concrete and buried.
``GSX is doing a good job in doing what they're doing.
I think they're handling it in a safe manner,'' said Gov. Carroll Campbell.
Some area opponents, however, say constantly changing burial requirements have made them unwilling participants in a test of developing technology.
When federal regulations changed in 1985 from one layer of clay and plastic to two, earlier burial cells were not retrofitted.
And a monitoring system crucial for detecting leaks has been upgraded from eight to about 50 wells since 1983.
``As technology progresses, we adopt it,'' said GSX Vice President Roger Davis.
``Certainly nobody's claiming perfection, but we just do the best we know how to do.''
Hallman, a Republican who calls South Carolina ``the septic tank of the nation,'' has organized a bipartisan environmental caucus of 18 state House and Senate members he hopes will push legislation endorsed by the DHEC board phasing out permanent burial of chemical waste by 1992 and creating a state-owned disposal site so South Carolina could refuse out-of-state waste.
Court rulings have said that prohibitions on out-of-state waste headed to a private facility interfere with interstate commerce.
The DHEC board also called for burial fee increases from $13 to $95 per ton for in-state waste and $18 to $180 per ton for out-of-state waste.
The money would go into an existing state fund to be used for any cleanup at the site.
A 1985 DHEC study estimated that cleanup costs would approach $1 billion if all of the landfill's holding cells were breached.
The state requires only $6 million in insurance, though GSX maintains a $30 million policy.
House members rank the DHEC proposals second behind the politically charged issue of auto insurance reform among the biggest issues facing them this year.
The proposals will be challenged by manufacturers -- including the state's biggest industry, textiles -- who use the GSX site extensively.
They say such moves could increase costs and mean the loss of jobs.
The South Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association voted in December to fight.
``Closing of the facility would create more problems than it would solve and could lead to improper disposal of hazardous waste in other locations,'' said E. Blair Rice, chairman of the group's environmental committee.
A November public hearing on the GSX permit drew a rowdy crowd of 2,000 people, many of whom stayed seven hours to berate DHEC and GSX.
Carol Boykin, who first opposed the landfill and helped organize Citizens Asking for a Safe Environment after a 1984 hearing, says it has mobilized her as she expects SRP and the other environmental dilemmas to affect others.
``We grew up truly believing that government would protect us,'' she said.
``I think we've come to realize that our state and federal government are not necessarily going to protect us.
We're going to have to protect ourselves.''
The long Palestinian uprising has brought bitterness to Israeli humor, and the comedian's opener was not meant to put his audience at ease.
``Soldiers in uniform get in with a discount,'' Yonathan Geffen said, and after a pause: ``Soldiers with clubs get in free.''
He referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 300 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded.
Such a joke would have been unthinkable before the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987.
In night clubs, theaters and galleries, artists of various kinds grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the brutalizing effect on Israeli society of the army's handling of the uprising.
A satire by nightclub performer Dudu Topaz takes the form of an army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young Palestinian urinated on a soldier's leg.
The army arrests his entire family and destroys their house, and an officer declares on the radio: ``The youth was known as a potential terrorist.''
A reporter finds the perpetrator, but discovers he is not yet old enough to talk.
Performing artists have collided with those who control state-run radio and television.
Topaz was barred from a radio talk show for two weeks for comments critical of the army.
Israel television rejected a skit by comedian Tuvia Tzafir that attacked public apathy by depicting an Israeli family watching TV while a fire raged outside.
Lyrics in ``Coexistence With Love,'' a new album by vocalist Astar Shamir, accuse the government of failing to explore options for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation.
As one of her songs, ``A Moment Before the Storm,'' puts it: ``My brother isn't a cruel soldier, but he's cold in his soul.
He stands there with his hand on the trigger, but he hates the war. ... Don't send my brother to the trigger.''
Ms. Shamir said in an interview: ``When I sat opposite the television last January, and they started showing me what was happening, I couldn't sleep nights.
I know songs don't change things and can't move armies, but ... they just came pouring out.''
Early last year, army radio banned pop singer Si Hyman's song ``Shooting and Crying'' about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury four young Palestinians alive in a West Bank village.
The victims survived, and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year.
``Have we forgotten our children were killed, too?''
Hyman asks in the chorus, alluding to the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews.
In a Jaffa nightclub, Tzafir performs a skit accusing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace.
It depicts Shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a wall chart that says, ``There are Palestinians,'' and in smaller letters, ``There is a chance for peace.''
``My vision is too good,'' Shamir says.
``I need something to block all this out.''
Palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs and plays.
Words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward rhetoric: ``With the Molotov (gasoline bomb), with the stones, I make my revolution. ... With the stones, we get rid of the enemy.''
An art exhibit at the Hakawati Theatre in Arab east Jerusalem was a series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion.
The new play ``Waiting for the Savior'' depicts buffoon-like Israeli soldiers harassing Palestinians going about their daily lives.
``Everything is political,'' said Jamal Ghosheh, director of the theatre.
``We are talking about our lives.
Our lives are political.''
For Israeli performers, who do active and reserve army duty like everyone else, it is more complicated.
At one point in his show, Topaz stopped and said, ``I wonder if I have the right to do this.
I'm laughing at everyone, but I'm laughing at myself as well, because I, too, am a soldier.''
The comedian, whose father came here from the Soviet Union, said in an interview: ``This is not the country I wanted.
It's not the kind of behavior I want.
If someone had told my father he was coming to live in a country that would rule another nation, he never would have come.''
President Reagan took the high road in his farewell address after two recent attempts to blame some of his administration's most notable failures on congressional meddling or the Washington establishment.
``Tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue,'' the president said in his televised message Wednesday night.
Reagan sounded positive notes reminiscent of earlier speeches throughout his political career -- the pre-eminent position of ``We the People'' in the American system, the image of America as a shining ``city upon a hill,'' the importance of paying more attention to American history.
There was no mention of the ``iron triangle'' of members of Congress, the news media and special interest groups who, in a speech to political appointees in Washington on Dec. 13, Reagan claimed had prevented his administration from balancing the federal budget.
Nor did he argue, as he did in a speech at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville Dec. 16, that Congress had perpetuated a dangerous situation in Central America by its ``on-again, off-again indecisiveness'' on his program of aid to the anti-communist Contra rebels.
There was no mention at all of the Contras, the arms sales to Iran or the enormous trade deficits that during Reagan's tenure have turned America into the world's biggest debtor nation.
Instead, Reagan stuck to the simple, patriotic themes that have served him so well in his political career.
``There is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time,'' the president said.
The best-known such warnings are George Washington's caution in 1797 against ``entangling alliances'' and Dwight Eisenhower's message in 1961 about the excessive influence of ``the military-industrial complex.''
Reagan did not come up with a similar catchword.
Rather, he asked a question: ``Are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world?''
He didn't give an outright answer to that question, but he made it pretty clear that he thinks things have gone awry.
``Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children,'' he said.
``And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style.
``We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.''
It was an inspirational message, unlikely to arouse the kind of criticism that greeted his attacks on Congress or the ``iron triangle.''
Instead of blaming Congress on Wednesday for his failures, he thanked the people for his successes.
``I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what very few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me,'' he said.
``They never saw my troops; they never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people.''
He even modestly differed from the phrase so often used to describe his skills at exactly what he was doing Wednesday night.
``I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference -- it was the content,'' he said.
``I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full blown from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation.
``My friends, we did it.''
In foreign affairs, he said he wanted ``the new closeness'' with the Soviet Union to continue but warned that it can do so ``only as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner.''
It was a sentimental speech unlikely to go into history with those by Eisenhower or Washington as they concluded their presidencies.
But it was a speech that celebrated what he called ``common sense'' and encapsulated his relationship to the people in simple imagery.
``One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart,'' he said.
``You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass -- the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return.
And so many times I wanted to stop, and reach out from behind the glass, and connect.''
Whatever else it was, it was vintage Reagan.
A Texas professor who helped mount President Nixon's unsuccessful attempt to resist a key Watergate subpoena is being considered for the post of U.S. solicitor general.
Charles Alan Wright, 61, a civil law expert and scholar who helped formulate the executive-privilege claim for refusing to surrender tapes of Oval Office conversations during the Watergate affair, is one of five or six candidates under consideration for the job, said a source close to the selection process.
Also being considered are Judge Ralph K. Winter of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City and Judge Kenneth Starr of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They are among the candidates being considered by President-elect Bush's transition team in conjunction with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
Justice Department sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the appointment, which must be confirmed by the Senate, would not be made without Thornburgh's consent.
The job of the department's top legal policy maker and chief appellate lawyer will be vacated when Solicitor General Charles Fried leaves office Jan. 20 to return to Harvard University Law School.
The solicitor general decides whether the government will appeal lower court rulings against federal agencies in virtually all cases.
He personally argues many cases before the high court.
The solicitor general is called the 10th justice in legal circles because he is traditionally viewed by the high court as a source of legal guidance.
Wright, a University of Texas law professor, served as one of Nixon's lawyers in 1973 and 1974 while the Watergate special prosecutor was trying to subpoena the White House tapes.
He helped devise the constitutional argument that as president, Nixon was immune from judicial subpoena because of executive privilege.
The Supreme Court ruled 8-0 in 1974 that executive privilege did not protect Nixon from having to surrender evidence needed in a criminal case.
The decision led to Nixon's resignation.
The high court ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes, which contained damaging evidence of White House involvement in the Watergate cover-up.
Winter, 53, a former Yale University law professor who took the bench in 1982, and Starr, a fellow appointee of President Reagan, are both known as judicial conservatives.
Starr, who served as counselor to Attorney General William French Smith from 1981 prior to taking the bench in 1983, had been mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee after his former colleague on the District of Columbia circuit, Robert Bork, failed to win Senate confirmation in 1987.
There is speculation in the Washington legal community that because of his relative youth, the 42-year-old Starr would be willing to give up his lifetime judicial appointment to better position himself for a future nomination to the Supreme Court.
Starr is an unpredictable conservative, who has not always voted with the Reagan administration on major cases before the appeals court here.
He is viewed by some as a more moderate member of the conservative wing of the circuit, which also includes Judges James L. Buckley, Douglas H. Ginsburg, Laurence Silberman, David Sentelle and Stephen Williams.
While best known for his role as a defender of executive privilege during Watergate, Wright has a formidable reputation as a legal scholar, particularly as an expert on federal court procedure.
He is the coauthor of a multi-volume standard textbook on the subject and has argued before the Supreme Court, notably against the abolition of the death penalty and against lowering the voting age to 18.
He lost both of those cases.
His position on the death penalty, however, was ultimately vindicated when the Supreme Court later reinstated capital punishment.
A professed conservative Republican, Wright wrote in 1960 that he supported Nixon's presidential candidacy because: ``I have more confidence in Dick Nixon the man than in Jack Kennedy the man.''
But four years later, Wright said he would vote against Barry Goldwater because he felt the Arizona senator supported a ``slowdown on civil rights'' and would take a ``harder, more dangerous line on foreign relations.''
To avoid identifying several Latin American government officials as working for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Reagan administration withheld certain documents from the trial of Lt. Col. Oliver North, The Miami Herald reported today.
Quoting unidentified sources close to the Iran-Contra inquiry, the newspaper says the administration feared that any discussion of the documents in court might disrupt U.S. intelligence in several countries.
One source said some of the withheld documents were declassified during congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, but were later reclassified in an effort to limit discussion of the incidents they describe, the Herald said.
Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh asked that the two major charges against North be dismissed after the Reagan administration refused to allow certain documents to be used in North's trial.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell is expected to act on Walsh's request this week.
The newspaper said some of its sources are closely tied to North's defense team while others either worked closely with North in the past or participated in the 1987 congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair.
One of the sources is a senior administration official who advises the State Department and the White House on Central American security policy, the newspaper said.
Countries listed in the documents, the sources said, include Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela where -- respectively -- North's resupply network aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels built an airstrip, controlled part of an air base and attempted to buy military aircraft.
North's activities in these countries were central to Walsh's legal strategy to show that the former National Security Council aide conspired to defraud the United States and steal government property by using the profits from arms sales to Iran to purchase supplies for the Contras.
Those are the charges Walsh says he must withdraw.
In each case, the sources said, Walsh has documentary evidence, including invoices, receipts and other legal papers, showing transactions involving Iran arms sales profits and Contra supplies.
Jan Lewczenko hasn't mastered English yet, but he reached a pinnacle in the dwindling art of deep-cut crystal glassmaking when he cut the bowl Congress will give George Bush on Inauguration Day.
``It was like a dream come true,'' the shy Polish immigrant said from his job at the Lenox Crystal Inc. plant in Mount Pleasant, 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
Lewczenko, 39, is one of fewer than 25 master deep cutters in the country and of four on the Lenox staff.
His experience cutting difficult designs nominated him for the bowls ordered by the Joint Congressional Committee on the Inauguration, plant superintendent Randy Eshland said Friday.
Lewczenko, pronounced Lev-chenko, is not known as a talkative man.
He did little more in a telephone interview than express his pride in the assignment and the finished piece.
``He's excited and bashful about all the publicity going on around him.
He's not comfortable about it.
He's (a) rather quiet man,'' his wife, Krystyna, 33, said from their home in Mount Pleasant.
``This is like American dream come true, especially ... coming to this country with 3-year-old kid, without language and $100 on hand,'' she said.
Lewczenko's pride was infectious, said Barbara Handyside, the 33-year-old Lenox designer who interpreted the congressional committee's ideas and worked side-by-side with Lewczenko.
``The enthusiasm was just overwhelming.
That was part of the excitement in working with him,'' Miss Handyside said from Lenox headquarters in Lawrenceville, N.J. The first gift Bush receives Jan. 20 and the only one he's scheduled to get at the inaugural luncheon will be Congress's crystal bowl of nearly 20 pounds and nearly 9 inches in diameter, according to Lenox.
Vice President Dan Quayle will receive a smaller version of the bowl, which Lwwczenko also cut.
Lenox declined to reveal the price of the bowls.
Blossoming cherry trees engraved on the front of each bowl frame a transparent area through which the west face of the Capitol is visible engraved on the far side of the bowl.
The president's bowl rests on a 14-pound, beveled, lead glass plinth, or flat base.
It is inscribed with Bush's name and the words ``Bicentennial Inauguration, Jan. 20, 1989.''
Rendering an architectural scene on a curved surface complicated the cutting, which was accomplished by holding the hefty piece against diamond-and carborundum-tipped cutting tools.
``It makes it even more difficult seeing through the glass to cut,'' said John Potts, vice president of manufacturing for Lenox.
``The skill is to make sophisticated and accurate cuts when your're holding a heavy piece such as this.''
``To hand hold this thing absolutely steady through the hours that it takes to polish this thing is absolutely unimaginable,'' Miss Handyside said.
Lewczenko showed an aptitude for skilled work while sculpting clay as a child, his wife said.
He studied at a glass-cutting school in Poland then spent 20 years cutting glass there.
He and his wife and son, Matthew, now 10, immigrated to the United States in April 1983, two weeks before huge antigovernment protests at the Lenin shipyards.
Lewczenko worked as an maintenance man while building a glass-cutting machine at home to create pieces to prove himself as a cutter.
A one-year stint at a New Jersey glass studio led to his job at Lenox.
An automobile magazine that couldn't resist the trademark battle between General Motors Corp. and an Italian gun maker did a ``road test'' comparison of Beretta, the pistol, and Beretta, the Chevy.
Car and Driver, its editorial tongue planted firmly in its cheek, has a story in its current issue with the headline: ``We've shot from the hip before, but never like this.''
Fabbrica d'Armi P. Beretta SpA, the gun company, sued GM for $250 million in federal court in New York last July, claiming that the car infringes on the pistol's trademark.
The case is pending.
The Car and Driver comparison was thought up by Editor William Jeanes, and was written by New York Contributing Editor Bruce McCall.
``For our test, we chose a 1989 Beretta V-6 GTU two-door notchback coupe and a 1989 Beretta 16-round Model 92F 9mm Parabellum, the spiffiest models in their respective lineups,'' McCall wrote.
The magazine listed these details:
Curb weight: Beretta, the pistol, 2.5 pounds; Beretta, the Chevy, 2,847 pounds.
Top speed: Beretta, the gun, 878 mph (at the barrel end); Beretta, the sedan, 114 mph.
Price, as tested: Beretta, the semiautomatic, $596; Beretta, the car with an automatic transmission, $15,428.
Along with the facts and figures, there are some performance opinions in the article:
--``The Beretta 92F (the pistol) ... hates corners more than any device C-D has tested since the 1964 AMC Marlin.''
--``We liked the solid heft and natural feel of the Italian lightweight.
It falls easily to hand. ... No such provision is designed into the five-speed Getrag shifter fitted to our U.S. test sample, perhaps because while the Italian aims to be on the hip of everybody in uniform, the American aims only to be uniform among everybody hip.''
--``You can field-strip the Italian in minutes without tools, while the same task performed on the Chevy would require countless hours and untold broken fingernails.''
A generation ago, when this was Saigon, American officers lived and played in the Rex Hotel, a sandbagged fortress frequently silhouetted against the night sky by flares and tracer bullets.
Today, sedans instead of jeeps drive up to its doors, and uniformed doormen rather than military guards greet them.
The Rex now beckons foreign businessmen and tourists, not soldiers.
This is the new Vietnam, leaving its course of economic self-destruction, opening its doors, courting capitalism.
Its young are attuned more to American jeans, pop music and the good life than to a war with America they never really knew.
``In 1975, at that time, I was just seven; I don't know anything,'' said Thu An, a 20-year-old classical violinist studying at the Ho Chi Minh Conservatory of Music.
It was in April of 1975 that the long war ended.
In the fifth floor restaurant of the Rex, beneath the chandeliers, Thu An entertains American tourists with such ballads as ``I Left My Heart In San Francisco'' and ``The Shadow of Your Smile'' as they dine on lobster and Chateaubriand.
There even was a ``Happy Birthday'' salute -- that venerable bit of Americana -- for Jackie Gershen, a San Diego travel agent who turned 47.
Black-tied waiters brought a birthday cake decked with lighted candles.
For the masses, things remain the same, at least for the moment.
They struggle to survive along with their proud and stubborn country, which exiled itself and waited in vain for what it considered its due from the world for standing up to the Giant of the West.
Throngs of unemployed wander the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, once the boisterous capital of South Vietnam.
Vietnam's unemployment rate is about 25 percent and the cost of living increased in 1988 by 7 percent to 11 percent a month.
Like the violinist Thu An, many young Vietnamese have no emotional attachment to the war, in which the United States took part from 1961 to 1975.
They are restless, impatient, looking to personal futures of education, jobs and travel abroad.
They envy affluent Asian neighbors and countrymen who went to America as refugees and prospered.
Some older southerners live in the past, the good old days when millions of American dollars propped up the economy and brought Saigonese the luxuries they no longer can afford.
More workers and government officials are speaking out about the hardships.
Nguyen Van Thuong, maitre d'hotel at the Ramuncho Restuarant favored by Americans in the war years, is unhappy with the measly $50 a month he is paid for the same job at the Rex.
``I do not have enough food for my family,'' said Thuong, who is 53 and has six children.
``I work much but I receive nothing.
At Ramuncho, I was happy.''
He looked around the room and added: ``There are government officials everywhere, but we don't scare because our life go down.''
Some officials agree with him.
One is Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a Harvard-educated economist for the old Saigon regime who advises the communist government in Hanoi and serves in the National Assembly.
``It has deteriorated,'' he said.
``We try very hard to keep some of the hotels in a decent state so the foreign investors can come in.
We need capital.
We need more industrial ventures.
We need technology.
We have plenty of labor.''
The Vietnamese look to the United States for these necessities of transition from failed central planning to a market-oriented economy that allows free enterprise, competition and foreign investment.
Oanh said it does not mean the end of communism, or socialism as it is called here.
He explained:
``Socialism is not an end in itself.
There are so many variations of the same thing.
We try very hard to keep away from ideology.
``Whatever the Americans, the Europeans have done, this is the result of thousands of years of experience.
Let's just take that.
Don't say this belongs to capitalism or what.
Take the best of both worlds and build the economy of Vietnam.''
In keeping with the new approach, Oanh was blunt in evaluating the economy:
``We have had a lot of state enterprise, but these guys are no good because they just wait for the government. ... They don't care whether (what they make) can be sold or not.
``Now it's different.
We now allow the private businessman to really worry about production so they have to watch their step.
They have to worry about marketing, everything, just like any other businessman.''
Vietnam now imports three times more than it exports, but officials hope the United States will help by providing financial aid and lifting its trade embargo once diplomatic relations are established.
They say that should happen within a few years.
A major sticking point is the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, which began with an invasion in December 1978.
Occupation troops and the government Vietnam installed are fighting a civil war with Cambodian guerrillas.
``If there is a political solution, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops at the latest by next September,'' said Maj.
Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor of the army newspaper.
``If there is no political solution now, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops in 1990.
There will be nothing to settle and to debate.
Then the Americans will have no reason not to establish diplomatic relations.''
Half a million southerners, many of whom worked for the U.S. government, have applied for exit visas to America, to join relatives or in hopes of jobs and business opportunities.
Tens of thousands have spent years trying to get out and their struggle has an ironic counterpoint: Members of the first emigrant wave, many of them now American citizens, return by the thousands for short visits with relatives and pour badly needed dollars into the economy.
Gen. Nguyen Vinh Nghi, 58, who was captured by North Vietnamese troops shortly before the fall of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975, hopes to take his wife and three children to the United States.
He was released from prison camp a year ago and says: ``I have nothing to do here.''
Public school officials, concerned that students may be living on the streets, opened homeless shelters in two Houston schools Thursday so needy pupils can get beds, showers and a meal.
A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an abandoned house was the first of eight people to enter the shelters, officials said.
``We didn't discuss anything with the child when she came in,'' said school board President Melody Ellis.
``Right now she's playing checkers with one of the administrators.
We just tried to give her encouragement and let her play.''
The shelters will remain open nightly until at least Jan. 20, when the superintendent the Houston Independent School District will recommend to the school board that the program be continued or modified.
Within an hour of opening, six children arrived at the shelters, and Ms. Ellis said four other young boys who showed up at one of the campuses left before entering, apparently because of television cameras nearby.
``It is drizzling outside and it is extremely cold, and I would really like for these children to come in,'' Ms. Ellis said when asking reporters to leave the area.
Temperatures were in the low 40s Thursday night.
By late evening eight youths and one parent were in the two shelters, including a homeless woman with five children, all enrolled in Houston schools, and a 14-year-old dropout.
Houston is estimated to have 20,000 to 25,000 people who live on the streets or in shelters, but it's uncertain how many of those are children.
The school shelters are not intended for children whose families are staying in city shelters, but rather for those pupils who seem to live alone on the streets.
``We've had teachers discovering students sleeping in areas around schools, storing clothes under houses in the neighborhood and some who are asking for help,'' school district spokesman Larry Yawn said.
It's not certain why those pupils are on the streets, however.
Judy Hay, of Harris County Children's Protective Services, said use of the term ``homeless'' for the school program may be a misnomer.
``I know there's children out there,'' she said.
``But I certainly didn't think they were in school.
These children have a home somewhere, but they either are abused or choose not to be at home.''
Ms. Hay said programs already exist for ``truly homeless'' children, whose parents, for example, may be living out of their cars.
Other social service programs also exist for children who need a ``cooling-off'' time away from their parents, she said.
``There are vacancies in shelters right now,'' Ms. Hay said.
``It's going to be interesting to find out what these principals have been seeing.''
Under the Schoolhouse Shelters program, approved this week and announced Wednesday, volunteers from the school system and other social agencies will staff the shelters, which officials hope may lead to more permanent assistance for homeless youths seeking help in a familiar place.
One school is set up to handle children from kindergarten through eighth grade.
The other is intended for high school students.
The Red Cross has donated 75 beds and blankets.
Existing showers and dressing rooms in gymnasiums of the schools will be used, officials said.
The cost to the school district, while not yet determined, should be minimal, officials said.
The district is providing food -- soup and sandwiches -- and security guards.
The program will serve only students enrolled in the Houston Independent School District, among the nation's 10-largest districts with about 190,000 students.
Security officers will guard against drugs and weapons, and Yawn said hand-held metal detectors will be used at the school entrance.
Students entering the shelters, operated from 5:30 p.m. until 7 a.m., will have to prove they are enrolled before entering.
Surviving crew members of the World War II submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with George Bush, the young Navy pilot they dubbed ``Ellie the Elephant'' after rescuing him from the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago.
Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull a grateful Bush to safety from his orange life raft onto the Finback's deck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty ``welcome aboard,'' but recalls little else about the incident.
``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Kohler, a retired Chicago businessman.
``Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the United States.''
Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, Bush eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing duties, watched Betty Grable movies in the wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two enemy ships.
Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old Bush as a gregarious jokester who earned the nickname ``Ellie'' for his comic wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recent telephone interviews.
``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very personable,'' said retired Rear Adm.
Lawrence Heyworth of Virginia Beach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer when Bush was hauled aboard on Sept. 2, 1944.
Said Heyworth: ``All three pilots we rescued were bright, bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing and had the most ebullient personality.
He was the most entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot.
``We called him Ellie because of his outstanding imitation of an elephant trumpeting.
Ellie the Elephant.
It wasn't because we all sat around thinking we were Republicans.
We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie.
We just thought elephants were funny.
We kept asking George to do it over and over again.''
``He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled W.E. ``Bill'' Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent and retired Navy commander.
As a bearded ensign aboard the Finback, Edwards filmed Bush's rescue with an 8mm Kodak movie camera.
Edwards said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers and enlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend Bush's swearing-in at noontime Jan. 20 at the Capitol.
They and a few of Bush's former flying buddies plan to sit together in prime bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue for the inaugural parade after Bush takes the presidential oath of office.
Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion for Bush and his old submarine buddies at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House, possibly next Wednesday.
Heyworth and Edwards have stayed in touch with Bush over the years.
But most of the Finback veterans haven't seen or spoken to Bush since he left the submarine at Midway Island after a month-long combat patrol.
Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing his bombing run against a Japanese radio communications center in the Bonin Islands, about 600 miles south of Japan, after his Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in flames.
Bush bailed out over the water but his two crew members were lost.
According to his autobiography, Bush's only injuries were a gash on the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war.
He was picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachute hit the ocean.
``I'm proud of what I was able to do to help Mr. Bush on board our boat,'' said Kohler.
But Dan Moody, 71, a Finback veteran and retired radiation laboratory technician living in Albany, Calif., gave little thought to Bush at the time.
``We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,'' he said, and then forgot him.
``I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' Moody said.
``Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''
A 75-year-old widow in need of money said officials tricked her out of a masterpiece for a pittance.
A court agreed, giving the first round to her in one of three swindles that have shaken the French museum world.
Last month, the court convicted the city of Strasbourg and its Museum of Decorative Arts of fraud in the purchase from Marie-Madeleine Falbisaner of an unsigned painting attributed to Simon Vouet, court painter of King Louis XIII.
When the museum did not return the painting as ordered, a magistrate charged chief curator Jean-Daniel Ludmann, 51, with ``breach of trust,'' for failing to do so.
``My family has lived for generations in Strasbourg and I wanted the family heirloom to remain here,'' Mrs. Falbisaner said in a telephone interview.
``This is what I get for being sentimental.
I was gypped.''
Ludmann, the museum and Strasbourg have appealed.
A decision is expected within two years and Mrs. Falbisaner hopes to recover the painting, now in storage at the museum.
``Knock wood, I won't die before then,'' she said.
Also in December, charges were brought against Pierre Rosenberg, chief curator of paintings at the Louvre, for involvement in the purchase of a work by 17th century portraitist Bartolome Esteban Murillo for half its estimated worth.
Rosenberg, a scholar with an international reputation, was accused of either knowing or purposely ignoring the fact that the painting, ``The Gentleman of Seville,'' might have been stolen from its owner, an elderly, eccentric heiress who died under suspicious circumstances in 1986.
Another elderly widow saw justice done in December when an unsigned painting by Nicolas Poussin was returned to her and she sold it for $1.4 million.
Twenty years ago, her husband sold it for the equivalent of $366 to the Louvre, whose experts had noticed the mislabeled painting in a sale catalogue.
After the museum displayed it as a Poussin, the family sued.
The court ruled that the Louvre did not have the right to use its vast resources and expertise to cheat ordinary citizens.
French museums have been an elite preserve, some say above the law, so newspapers recounted the unfolding dramas like installments in a seamy soap opera.
``Is there something rotten in the kingdom of museums?''
art critic Bruno Foucart asked in Beaux Arts magazine, recalling Hamlet's moral dilemma.
``Curator Tripped Up By Canvas,'' one headline sniffed.
An editorial by Gerard Dupuy in the newspaper Liberation was called ``The Scholar Gone Astray.''
The latest episode is known as the Vouet Affair for the 17th century portraitist who experts say is the likely creator of Mrs. Falbisaner's unsigned ``Allegory of Force.''
Mrs. Falbisaner's story began in 1986 when she decided to supplement her monthly pension of about $450 by selling ``Allegory'' to the city of Strasbourg for about $55,000.
It had been in the family for more than 250 years and was believed to be the work of Vouet, who introduced the Italian Baroque School to France.
Experts examined the painting before the sale, however, and to Mrs. Falbisaner's chagrin, concluded it was a high-quality example of the Vouet school but not by the master himself.
The museum still was interested, however, and curator Ludmann borrowed the work to examine its condition, a standard procedure.
Without telling Mrs. Falbisaner, he took the painting to the Louvre for laboratory examinations, including X-rays.
Tests indicated the work was by Vouet, or at the very least attributable to him.
That information was not passed on to Mrs. Falbisaner.
Ludmann sent an enthusiastic letter to city officials urging them to approve the sale.
The tests, he wrote, ``reveal the existence of several retouchings by the artist himself.''
He said the price was ``more than reasonable, and assuredly advantageous, given Vouet's fame and his value on today's market.''
Both the Louvre and Strasbourg officials have denied formally authenticating the work as a Vouet.
``I'm convinced the essentials of the painting -- its composition, idea and colors -- are Vouet,'' Ludmann told The Associated Press, but added that he cannot be certain because the work is unsigned.
Big money is at stake.
In today's art market, a Vouet is estimated to be worth up to $500,000, nearly 10 times what the museum agreed to pay Mrs. Falbisaner.
Many in the art world say privately they are delighted to see museums get a comeuppance, but have closed ranks publicly, dismissing the scandals as the price of becoming fashionable.
``Ten years ago, no one outside the museum world would have noticed,'' one said privately.
``Today, a curator is a superstar who appears on television and dines with the mayor.''
Ann Cremin, a respected art critic, said: ``The museums, because of their limited acquisitions budgets, have to be on the lookout for bargains.
``These kinds of affairs have probably happened countless times in the past.
The difference is the money involved.
The ordinary person today hires a good lawyer to get the property back, and the story makes the papers.''
Congressmen, teachers, and Saudi princes will no longer be invited by NASA to be passengers on the space shuttle under a new policy that emphasizes completing the recovery from the Challenger accident in which two non-astronauts were killed.
The space agency announced a new category of ``space flight participants'' and said, at the same time, that flight opportunities for them ``are not available at this time.''
Before the Challenger exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, NASA had given minimum training to a senator, a member of the House of Representatives, a Saudi Arabian prince and Christa McAuliffe, the first ``Teacher in Space.''
Mrs. McAuliffe was killed along with industrial engineer Gregory Jarvis and five astronauts.
``The Challenger accident marked a major change in the U.S. outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than NASA astronauts,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in the policy statement Thursday.
``NASA and interested external parties, domestic and international, must re-examine previous understandings, expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.''
At the time of the Challenger explosion, the process of choosing a reporter to fly on the shuttle was in its final stages.
Committees had winnowed down thousands of applications to 40.
When the shuttle does begin flying non-essential passengers again, NASA said, a teacher will be the first.
The agency said that for now, flight opportunities generally will be limited to professional astronauts and payload specialists essential for mission requirements while it works to improve the reliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog.
The new space flight participant category embraces those ``whose presence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation of payloads or for other essential mission mission activities, but is determined by the administrator of NASA to contribute to other approved NASA objectives or to be in the national interest.''
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 and Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was aboard in January 1986, at the invitation of NASA's administrator.
Both hold positions important to the space program on congressional committees and the official explanation was that the flights were important to their oversight responsibilities.
In 1985, shuttle passengers included Sultan Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia and Rodolfo Neri Vela, a Mexican.
They were aboard, NASA said, to ``observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-B communications satellites for their countries.
NASA said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal of providing such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies to proving that the shuttle is safe and reliable.
``Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participants are not available at this time,'' NASA said.
``When NASA determines that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight participant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space in fulfillment of space education plans.''
All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five NASA astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for payload or other mission requirements, the agency said.
Such added crew members have to be chosen at least 12 months before the flight and first consideration will be given to NASA's own people.
Take two boys born today.
One is white.
The other is not.
The chances are five times greater that the non-white boy eventually will become a murder victim, the FBI says.
Non-white males born now face a 1 in 38 chance of ending up the victim of a killer, while the risk for white males born today is 1 in 204, according to a statistical study released Thursday.
The odds faced by the entire population born today are 1 out of 177, the study found.
Sharon Propheter, a statistician with the Uniform Crime Reporting program, cautioned that the predictions are based on 1987 figures and do not account for possible changes in the murder rate.
``We can't look into the future and say there are going to be so many murders in 1999,'' said Propheter, who prepared the report with statistician Harvey Rosenthal.
``This is based on what happened in 1987.''
The murder rate in 1987 was 8.3 per 100,000 population.
That year, there were an estimated 20,100 murders nationwide, of which 9,510 victims were non-white, 7,436 of them non-white males.
The murder rate in Canada for that year was 2.5 per 100,000.
Between 1967 and 1987, the U.S. murder rate leaped 34 percent, the FBI reported.
The highest rate in the past 10 years was 10.2 per 100,000 population in 1980, and the lowest was 7.9 per 100,000 in 1984 and 1985.
The FBI study was based on the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics added to a computer model.
It did not break down the non-white category for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other minorities, Propheter said.
If there were no murders, the average lifespan for all Americans would increase by almost 3 months, and the average lifespan for non-white males would increase by more than 11 months, the study found.
A person born now can expect to live about 75 years, according to health statistics.
The study -- which calculated the probabilities of being murdered for newborns, those age 20 and those age 40 -- predicted that while newborn non-white males have a 1 in 38 chance of becoming a murder victim, the chance for non-white females is 1 in 138.
For both sexes combined, the chance is 1 in 60.
For newborn white males, the risk is 1 in 204, while for white females, it's 1 in 437 for a combined chance of 1 in 277.
For newborns of all races, the chance of being murdered is 1 in 122 for males, 1 in 324 for females and 1 in 177 for both sexes.
The least likely to be murdered -- among the ages calculated by the FBI -- are white women who are now 40.
They have only a 1 in 931 chance of being murdered.
Of all the groups now 40, the highest probability of being murdered remains non-white males, with a 1 in 97 chance.
The overall odds for that age group is 1 out of 453.
As for men who already have reached age 20, non-whites have a 1 in 41 chance of being murdered, while whites have a 1 in 224 chance, for an overall chance of 1 in 136.
For females who are now 20, non-whites have a 1 in 157 likelihood of being murdered, and whites have a 1 in 504 chance for a total probability of one in 376.
Looming shortages of skilled labor can be eased by relying more on older workers, provided they receive training and their old-age benefits are protected, according to a group of Labor Department studies.
``Educational reform in public schools should eventually maximize the labor force of the future, but cannot immediately remedy the skills shortage of today's population,'' Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said Thursday in releasing the department studies.
``I think clearly that older workers should be tapped across the board.''
One of the reports, the department's first extensive analysis of potential labor shortages, said major shortages could occur because the economy is projected to grow at 2 percent to 3 percent annually while the rate of work force growth will be just 1 percent.
The median age of workers is projected to rise from the current 36 to 39 by the end of the century, with the number of people aged 45 and over increasing from the 1986 total of 74.2 million to 96.3 million.
The government said that most employers, while aggressively pursuing members of the shrinking pool of younger workers, have ignored the special needs of older workers, including flexible scheduling, job sharing, health care and phased retirements.
In some cases it actually costs older workers to continue working past the age when they are eligible to retire, the studies said.
That is because Social Security and private pension provisions often penalize beneficiaries who continue or resume working.
The Social Security penalties slowly are being phased out, but the report said that a faster timetable should be considered and that employers should revamp their private plans, offering employees incentives to work to a later age.
Another key to keeping older workers on the payroll, researchers said, is retraining employees to reflect the changing labor market.
``Far more attention needs to be given to the design of jobs and working conditions that are deliberately tailored to the distinctive capabilities, limitations, needs and preferences of older workers now employed and others who, under the right circumstances, might choose to become re-employed,'' the department said.
``The barriers are formidable but not insurmountable.''
The reports said the definition of older workers can vary, involving employees as young as 47 in some cases.
But most problems are faced by workers in their 60s.
Workforce participation drops significantly at age 62 and again at 65 because these are eligibility dates for Social Security and many pensions.
Early in William J. Bennett's tenure as secretary of education, when he was still on speaking terms with the National Education Association, the teacher union asked Bennett what he would do if he had a magic wand to wave over American s chools.
``No drugs -- none, zero, out, gone, disappear,'' replied the blunt-spoken educator.
``Give me a wand?
All the drugs: gone.''
During his 3 years in the Reagan Cabinet, the conservative and combative Bennett often spoke out about the drug ``plague'' and chafed at what he felt was an inadequate effort by the Reagan team to combat the problem.
Now, as President-elect Bush's choice to be the nation's first drug czar, it will fall on the shoulders of the burly former college football lineman to find a way to win that war.
Bennett, 45, was a headline-grabbing education secretary who railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards, and spoke his mind freely on topics in and out of his field, from defense of Western civilization courses to AIDS to a trip to Managua to thumb his nose at the Sandinista government.
His spirited defense of education budget cuts -- including a 1987 attempt to cut in half a $200 million drug education program -- made him unpopular with school groups and some lawmakers.
It was Bennett who made the call to embattled Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg in November 1987 suggesting Ginsburg withdraw because of his admitted use of marijuana while a law professor.
Bennett himself grew up in the raucous 1960s, flirted with the idea of joining the radical Students for a Democratic Society at Williams College and had a blind date as a graduate student in Texas with hard-rocking Janis Joplin, who later died of a drug overdose.
A onetime rock band guitarist, he is an unabashed fan of early rock 'n' roll of the Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens variety.
In an interview with The Associated Press after the Ginsburg affair, Bennett said he and Joplin just ``drank a couple of beers.''
He turned aside a question about whether he had ever used marijuana, saying, ``I will not join this procession of confessors.
If I have any confessions to make, I will make them to a priest.
I will stipulate for the record, however, I was young.''
But Bennett had said flatly in prior interviews that he never tried illicit drugs.
Bush was asked at Thursday's announcement if he knew his new drug czar was ``addicted to nicotine.''
Bush referred the question to Bennett, but added, ``He knows his mandate.''
Bennett, a longtime two-pack-a-day smoker, told reporters, ``You will not have a director of national drug control policy who smokes.''
Asked when he was quitting, Bennett, whose post requires Senate confirmation, said, ``By the time I'm national director.''
He left Reagan's Cabinet in September to write, open a small policy shop called the Madison Center, and deliver lectures at reported fees of up to $15,000-per-apperance.
He found fault with the Reagan war on drugs, best known for Nancy Reagan's ``just say no'' crusade.
``An all-out war on drugs -- with more resources for police, more prosecutors, more convictions, more jail sentences -- would be popular with the American people ... and it would be the right thing to do,'' Bennett said in an interview with the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review magazine.
``I wish we had done more in the area of drugs.
We have done a lot more than some people will give us credit for, but our policies on drugs could have been more coherent, more direct.
We could have taken not only the moral lead, which I think President Reagan did, but more of the legislative lead,'' he said.
According to an account in the New Republic last May 23, Bennett repeatedly urged the Pentagon and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese to unleash the U.S. military against foreign drug traffickers.
``The military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the Persian Gulf did to Iran's navy,'' Bennett reportedly advised in one memo.
Bennett is a Brooklyn-born son of a bank officer and a medical secretary who was raised in the Virginia suburbs of Washington after his parents divorced.
He majored in philosophy at Williams after abandoning plans to pursue a career in advertising.
After obtaining his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Texas at Austin and his law degree at Harvard, Bennett taught at several campuses and eventually ran the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park, N.C. He was chairman of NEH from 1981-1985.
As the third education secretary, he made headlines from the start, when he defended steep student aid cuts by suggesting some students would simply have to undergo ``divestiture of certain sorts: stereo divestiture, automobile divestiture, three-weeks-at-the-beach divestiture.''
He infuriated college administrators with his broadsides against rising costs, and once challenged them to start the new academic year by sending each of America's 12 million college students a letter warning that drug use would not be tolerated.
But even some of his enemies admired the flood of attention he brought to education.
In a Wall Street Journal poll of notables last spring, Bennett emerged as the choice for best Reagan appointee.
Bennett and his wife, Elayne, a social worker, have a 5-year-old son, John.

As competition heats up in Spain's crowded bank market, Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities.
Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank's privatization.
The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94% stake in Banco Exterior.
The government directly owns 51.4% and Factorex, a financial services company, holds 8.42%. The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges.
Some analysts are concerned, however, that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities.
Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services, they argue, will be difficult, particularly if market conditions turn sour.
If that proves true, analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992, when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers.
With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries, five branches and 12 representative offices abroad, the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor.
Mr. Luzon and his team, however, say they aren't interested in a merger.
Instead, they are working to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992.
"I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run," Mr. Luzon says.
Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports.
The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s, however, forcing the bank to face competition.
At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth.
As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ($7.04 billion) as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas.
The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs.
The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government, analysts say.
Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November, Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes.
But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy, cut costs, increase capital and build up new areas of business.
"We've got a lot to do," he acknowledged.
"We've got to move quickly."
In Mr. Luzon's first year, the bank eliminated 800 jobs.
Now it says it'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years.
The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad.
To strengthen its capital base, Banco Exterior this year issued $105 million in subordinated debt, launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors.
The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches.
Last year's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15% surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies.
Though Spain has an excess of banks, analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe, which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead.
Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets.
The bank says it's interested in purchasing banks in Morocco, Portugal and Puerto Rico.
But the bank's retail activities in Latin America are likely to be cut back.
Banco Exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July.
The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition.
But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where he was formerly director general, will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992.
The bank also says it'll use its international network to channel investment from London, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges.
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that "if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees."
But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that Mr. Ortega's threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."
The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders.
Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.
Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army.
Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.
He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.
Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.
And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March.
The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988.
While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said yesterday on "Meet the Press": "I would hope after his {Mr.
Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid."
Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue.
"The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid," said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.
"In these circumstances, I think they'd win."
Sen. Mitchell said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action.
Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.
Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers."
Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson, while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: "It's never very clear who starts what."
He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections.
Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections.
Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections.
"My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning" by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said.
Shoney's Inc. said it will report a write-off of $2.5 million, or seven cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended yesterday.
The restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its 1988 recapitalization as a result of a $160 million restructuring of its bank debt.
The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company's 1989 operating results.
In addition, the effective interest rate on the $410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66%. The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $4 million in interest expenses next year, or six cents a share.
Shoney's said the latest restructuring affected bank indebtedness that was incurred to finance $585 million of the company's $728 million recapitalization that took place in 1988.
The company has made payments of $175 million against the original $585 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.
These payments consisted of $54 million in scheduled payments and $121 million in prepayments, funded by $82.8 million from operating cash flow, zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales.
The Nasdaq over-the-counter market didn't fully recover from a selling stampede, and closed down 1.2%. The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers, who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally.
After plummeting 1.8% at one point during the day, the composite rebounded a little, but finished down 5.52, at 461.70.
In contrast, the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1%. The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4% lower for the day.
As usual, the over-the-counter market's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit.
Microsoft, battered by profit taking in recent sessions, sank as much as 4; but it finished at 80 7/8, down 2 1/4 on volume of one million shares.
MCI Communications, the most active issue, finished down 5/8 to 42 1/8.
MCI traded as low as 41 3/8 during the session.
Other active stocks included Jaguar, whose American depositary receipts added 1/8 to 11 1/4.
Apple Computer improved 7/8 to 47 5/8; Intel slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4, and Valley National Corp. was up 1/8 to 15 1/8.
"The market started with several strikes against it," said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel, and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating.
But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market, Mr. DaPuzzo said.
Even though the over-the-counter market usually doesn't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes, he said, "when the market does recover, the damage is done and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board."
Mr. DaPuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors.
While Shearson doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account, the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes, Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged.
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too.
They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically.
Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur.
That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will.
In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.
But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale.
The market makers say they aren't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly.
The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly, exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading.
Groused Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette: "It's making it tough for traders to make money."
He said that when sell programs kick in, many traders believe that "there's no sense in sticking your nose out because you're an instant loser."
Kinder-Care Learning Centers added 1/4 to 4 7/8 on 461,200 shares.
Lodestar Group said it will make a $6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company's shares in a pending rights offering by Kinder-Care Learning Center's parent, Kinder-Care Inc.
Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1/2, also up 1/4, on volume of 700,000.
Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1/8 to 49 1/2.
The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, down from $1.26 a year earlier.
The company estimated that losses from Hurricane Hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter.
The company said losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California haven't yet been determined, but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area.
Any quake-related losses will be reported in the fourth quarter, the company said.
North Atlantic Industries jumped 1 to 5 3/4.
The electronics-instruments maker is to be acquired by Asset Management Associates for $7.25 a share.
LIN Broadcasting slid 1 3/8 to 108 3/4, despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share, up from 39 cents the previous year.
The company said the latest quarter included about $3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to McCaw Cellular Communications' bid for the company and LIN's merger pact with BellSouth.
McCaw was unchanged at 40.
XL/Datacomp slid 2 1/4 to 16 1/2 amid continuing concerns about the company's contract negotiations with International Business Machines.
IBM is reviewing its entire business-partners program, and XL/Datacomp confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract.
Remarketers make modifications to IBM's computer hardware and resell the products.
Omni Capital Group surged 1 3/4 to 16 1/4.
The company said net rose to 38 cents a share in its fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30, from 35 cents a shares a year ago.
Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month, say individuals familiar with the company's strategy.
The size of the cuts isn't known, but they'll be centered in the exploration and production division, which is responsible for locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas.
Employees haven't yet been notified.
Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver.
This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil, which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15% to 20% during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout.
Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations.
In yesterday's third-quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a $40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations.
The report says that "the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations."
A company spokesman, reached at his home last night, would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week.
Most oil companies, including Mobil, have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings, largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses.
Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output.
Yesterday, Mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million loss in the third quarter, while comparable foreign operations earned $234 million.
Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year.
Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year.
Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified.
One Mobil executive said that the $40 million charge related to the action indicates "a substantial" number of people will be involved.
Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations.
Homestake Mining Co., San Francisco, blamed the continued slump in gold prices for an 83% plunge in third-quarter net income to $2 million, or two cents a share, from $11.2 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 5% to $110.4 million from $105.4 million.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Homestake closed at $15.25, down 25 cents.
"A significant increase in gold sales to 248,279 ounces for the quarter from 188,726 in the third quarter of 1988 was more than offset by the continued decline in average gold price realization to $367 from $429 per ounce," the company said.
For the nine months, the mining company posted a 40% drop in profit to $30.1 million, or 31 cents a share, from $50.6 million, or 52 cents a share, on a 6% rise in revenue to $323.2 million from $305.7 million.
Tandy Corp. said it won't join U.S. Memories, the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips.
Tandy's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories.
Last month, Apple Computer Inc. said that it wouldn't invest in the group.
Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development.
U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market dominated by the Japanese.
Those chips were in dire shortage last year, hurting many U.S. computer companies that couldn't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips.
Tandy said its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor.
"At this time, we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule," said Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning.
Sanford Kane, U.S. Memories president, said the decision was "disappointing," but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure.
"I would like to have had them," he said.
But "they weren't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it."
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June, when the group was formed by seven electronics companies: Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.; Hewlett-Packard Co.; Intel Corp.; International Business Machines Corp.; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.
Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week.
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst, he said, to inspire others to join.
But so far, most potential participants haven't decided.
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories' business plan.
Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation.
A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company hasn't made a decision yet, although "it isn't under active consideration."
In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.
David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination.
With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know.
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.
Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping "top secret" on their own complicity.
But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.
And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.
When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads.
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.
But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress?
For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?
What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?
Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol.
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you.
Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: Confiding in the United States may be fatal.
CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.
The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point.
"The interpretation" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, "and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me."
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA.
The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter.
And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties.
Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.
The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, deploring "Men of Zeal."
No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail?
Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security.
There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.
The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed.
In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility.
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.
As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal.
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him.
Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27% to $29.6 million, or 72 cents a share, from $40.7 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
Sales dropped 4% to $1.12 billion from $1.17 billion.
The company, which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers, said about half the earnings drop came from the "virtual collapse" of the Venezuelan auto industry.
The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year, making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts.
Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier.
The company, based in Toledo, Ohio, had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit.
Mary Anne Sudol, an analyst at Fitch Investors in New York, said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost "across the board."
Southwood J. Morcott, Dana's president, said the company's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength.
Cummins Engine Co., Columbus, Ind., hurt by a drop in engine orders from heavy-truck makers, reported a third-quarter loss of $39.7 million, or $4.12 a share, on essentially flat sales of $807.6 million.
In the year-earlier period, the maker of diesel engines and parts had a narrower deficit of $17.6 million, or $1.84 a share, with sales of $808.3 million.
A spokeswoman said shipments of truck engines, which provide a higher margin than most of the company's other products, declined 16% from a year earlier.
Although Cummins's stock stumbled last month after the company projected a "substantial" third-period loss, the stock also fell $1.125 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, to $51.75.
It traded as high as $64 a month ago, before the loss projection.
For the nine months, the latest loss trimmed net income to $3.6 million, which after payment of preferred dividends represented a 31-cent loss a common share.
The year-before loss was $8.4 million, or $1.36 a common share.
The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants.
The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting "the normal business functions" of companies charged under the racketeering law, a senior department official said.
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors "not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties" in a case brought under the racketeering law, the official, David Runkel, said.
The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines, Mr. Runkel said.
The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
Under that law, defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a "criminal enterprise" may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise.
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.
They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged.
The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense, Mr. Runkel said.
"That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt to seize the whole business; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime," he explained.
In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction, Mr. Runkel said.
Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume.
September program trading amounted to 13.8% of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares, the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988.
A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September, the second-highest level ever.
The highest level was in June 1989, when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies.
Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September.
Program trading amounted to 12.3% of average daily volume in June.
The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.
The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits.
It's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market.
Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September, but most of the firm's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage.
Overall, Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares.
The top stock-index arbitrage firm last month was Morgan Stanley & Co.
Of Morgan Stanley's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month, 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades.
Behind second-place Morgan Stanley were Kidder, Peabody & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit.
Call it the "we're too broke to fight" defense.
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments.
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it, even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled it's willing to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law.
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year.
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party, including FSLIC."
"If true," the court wrote, "this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits, because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988.
"This institution is just brain dead," says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm.
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour."
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.
"We're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory," he says.
"We'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize."
Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend, but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market.
"I'm not losing faith in the market," said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm.
But he's not so sure about everyone else.
"I think on Monday the small (investors) are going to panic and sell," predicted Mr. Sullivan, whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds.
"And I think institutions are going to come in and buy . . . I'm going to hold on.
If I sell now, I'll take a big loss."
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they didn't flee the market in 1987.
"Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday," said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky.
Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, "but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more."
At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm.
Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday.
But Robert Showalter, an official of the association, said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors' clubs are planned.
In fact, some of the association's members -- long-term, buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices.
"We hope to take advantage of it," said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club.
He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants.
Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however, and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
Marc Perkins, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said the market drop is one of "a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending.
There's no question that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders."
Mr. Perkins believes, however, that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $275 a share.
Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it.
"I have this feeling that it's built on sand," she says, that the market rises "but there's no foundation to it."
She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some Texaco stock.
Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school, "I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid."
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand.
"We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot," said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg.
"We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back.
Now it's happening again."
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and, to his regret, never went back even as the market soared.
This time he's ready to buy in "when the panic wears off."
Still, he adds: "We can't have this kind of thing happen very often.
When the little guy gets frightened, the big guys hurt badly.
Merrill Lynch can't survive without the little guy."
Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday, but mostly through mutual funds.
Discount brokerage customers "have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago," says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm.
Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp., says Schwab customers "have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks."
Individual investors are still angry about program trading, Mr. Quackenbush says.
Avner Arbel, a Cornell University finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to "win back the confidence of the small investor."
But it's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried.
Alan Helfman, general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston, said he and his mother have some joint stock investments, but the overall economy is his chief worry.
"These high rollers took a big bath today," he said in his showroom, which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston's richest citizens.
"And I can tell you that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati."
And, finally, there were the gloaters.
"I got out in 1987.
Everything," said Pascal Antori, an Akron, Ohio, plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments' LaSalle Street office.
"I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost."
Would Mr. Antori ever get back in?
"Are you kidding!
